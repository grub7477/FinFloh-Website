      transcript: `Amartya (Intro): Brenda brings two decades of O2C transformation experience — from Koch and Georgia Pacific to private equity environments — it’s a privilege to have her here.
Brenda: I’ve watched AR evolve from intercompany mail and paper processes to the real-time digital world we operate in today.
Amartya: Your journey across billing, collections, cash app, and O2C architecture shows how deeply you’ve lived this transformation.
Brenda: Back then, AR teams were always behind the curve — too much manual work, too many kickbacks, and not enough bandwidth to respond in real time.
Amartya: You highlight something powerful — transformation is never one big leap; it’s the small wins that compound.
Brenda: Those incremental automations saved hours of work and freed teams to actually drive change instead of just surviving the workload.
Amartya: Legacy environments make even simple tasks complex — stuffing envelopes, printing batches, waiting on mailroom timing.
Brenda: Moving from mailed invoices to digital delivery changed everything — speed, accuracy, and how quickly customers could act.
Amartya: I love the platform story — building a unified environment instead of relying on ERP limitations.
Brenda: Exactly — we built a self-sustaining system that works regardless of the ERP, as long as the data connects.
Brenda: Once we centralized data, accuracy improved and we could finally trust the numbers we were sending out.
Amartya: And that trust is everything — especially when rebates, accruals, or cashflow decisions depend on it.
Brenda: Automation was the reason we could operate smoothly during COVID — we weren’t dependent on printers, offices, or physical processes anymore.
Amartya: Today, AI can push this even further — bringing real-time communication and workflow automation across invoice-to-cash.
Brenda: AI lets us scan mailboxes, interpret customer responses, update accounts, and apply cash faster than manual teams ever could.
Amartya: It shifts teams from reacting days later to acting instantly — a massive upgrade for AR.
Brenda: For finance professionals, surround yourself with talent and empower your teams — they’re the ones closest to the real work.
Brenda: Give people freedom to challenge processes, break old ideas, and build better ways of working.
Brenda: When your teams succeed, you succeed — that mindset has shaped every transformation I’ve led.
Amartya (Closing): That philosophy—talent, empowerment, and continuous improvement—is exactly what drives modern O2C transformation.

      transcript: `Amartya (Intro): From E&Y and Deloitte to leading finance teams across the US, Canada, the Philippines, and India — Swarn’s journey is truly remarkable.

Swarn: My journey has been more of an evolution than a straight line — every role shaped how I lead today.

Amartya: You’ve scaled finance in global firms, driven M&A, optimized margins, and built teams across time zones — that’s a powerful mix of experience.

Swarn: Finance is no longer just about accuracy and compliance — it’s about value creation.

Amartya: The environment you described during post-COVID scaling shows how resilience and innovation go hand in hand.

Swarn: We achieved transformation by aligning process, cash, and technology together — not by blaming people.

Amartya: Managing teams across four geographies isn’t easy — collaboration and trust become the real foundation.

Swarn: Once you start leading a team, it’s not about managing geography — it’s about managing mindsets.

Amartya: I love your weekly Friday sync ritual — that cadence builds alignment and shared ownership.

Swarn: Empowerment means allowing people to make decisions without waiting for someone senior to approve.

Swarn: Clarity, empowerment, and understanding impact — that’s the culture we are building.

Amartya: Your 3 I’s of ERP — Integration, Intelligence, Insight — summarize the real gaps in enterprise systems perfectly.

Swarn: ERP systems still struggle with seamless integration and predictive insight — and that’s where AI comes in.

Amartya: Exactly — when systems connect and data flows cleanly, teams move faster and decisions improve.

Swarn: AI is not a threat — it’s a strength. It saves time, accelerates research, and enables smarter decisions.

Amartya: As finance teams adopt AI, the CFO role shifts from reporting the past to shaping the future.

Swarn: Think beyond accounting — the modern CFO is strategist, technologist, and storyteller.

Swarn: Stay curious — change is constant, and learning is the real competitive advantage.

Swarn: Financial leadership is no longer about control — it’s about contribution.

Amartya (Closing): That’s the mindset that will define the next generation of finance leaders — curiosity, collaboration, and courage to transform.

      keyTakeaways: [
        "Scaling finance requires trust, not control – Leading global finance teams across multiple countries requires more than tools and processes — it requires trust, clarity, and empowerment. Swarn emphasizes that mindset alignment is the foundation of high-performing distributed teams.",

        "Cash + Process + Technology = Transformation – Technology transformation came from unifying fragmented systems, automating the invoice lifecycle, and building a single source of truth for data.",

        "The 3 I’s of ERP reveal major gaps – Even with strong systems like SAP, Oracle, and NetSuite, ERPs struggle with Integration, Intelligence, and Insight. They lack seamless data flow and predictive capability — creating opportunities for AI-driven layers on top.",

        "AI is a multiplier, not a threat – Swarn believes AI accelerates research, improves decision-making, and frees time for strategic work. For finance leaders, the real shift is learning to use AI as an enabler — not fearing it as a replacement.",

      transcript: `Amartya (Intro): From flying jets in the U.S. Air Force to leading credit at one of California’s largest distributors — Deana’s story is truly inspiring.

Deana: My journey has been unusual — I went from being a pilot to discovering my passion in credit almost by accident.

Amartya: That transition from the Air Force to finance speaks volumes about adaptability and leadership under pressure.

Deana: When two companies merged to form Edges, we managed the entire transition without a single layoff — we found a place for everyone.

Deana: That experience taught me that empathy and people-first thinking can coexist with growth and performance.

Amartya: That’s powerful — empathy in leadership drives trust, and trust drives productivity.

Deana: The biggest challenge wasn’t technology — it was resistance to change. People in finance love stability, and transformation makes them nervous.

Deana: But I’ve learned to love change — every new system, every process improvement is an opportunity to get better.

Amartya: And automation is reshaping how credit teams operate — what used to take days can now happen in minutes.

Deana: Exactly. We went from PDF and paper-based credit applications to fully digital and mostly automated workflows.

Deana: Today, credit trade references, bank checks, and reports are integrated — automation has removed the backlog.

Amartya: It’s the perfect example of how technology removes friction but still needs human judgment to make the right calls.

Deana: Yes — data gives you signals, but experience gives you context. That balance matters.

Deana: AI can help too — imagine agents that instantly approve COD customers or flag the top five low-risk applications each morning.

Amartya: Prioritization like that changes everything — it links customer onboarding, credit scoring, and cashflow predictability in one loop.

Deana: And when credit and sales start working together, it’s not about saying no — it’s about saying how can we make this work.

Amartya: Exactly — when finance enables sales instead of blocking it, growth and risk control move hand in hand.

Deana: My mantra is simple — never stop learning. The more open you are to change, the better leader you become.

Deana: I still attend trade conferences and online courses — because technology evolves every day, and so should we.

Amartya (Closing): That’s what defines modern finance leadership — curiosity, collaboration, and courage to embrace change.

      transcript: `Amartya (Intro): Welcome to Episode 19 of Inside the CFO Office — today we’re speaking with Tracy Mitchell, Director of Accounts Receivable at Trinity Logistics.

Amartya: Tracy has built her career across AP, billing, and AR, and today leads AR at Trinity, bringing both operational depth and leadership insights.


Amartya (Question): Tracy, let’s start with your career journey — how did you find your way into AR leadership?


Tracy (Answer): I actually started out on a family farm in Delaware, worked my way through AP and billing, and eventually found my passion in accounts receivable.


Tracy (Work Insight): At Trinity, I’ve focused on making AR a partner to the business — not just a back-office function.


Tracy (Work Insight): We’ve transformed AR into a customer-facing team that supports growth while still protecting cash flow.


Amartya (Question): How do you see AR’s role in partnering with sales to drive business outcomes?


Tracy (Answer): The relationship between AR and sales is critical — if sales trusts us, we can work together to solve customer challenges before they escalate.


Tracy (Answer): Without that trust, customer conversations get harder and you end up fighting internally instead of focusing on solutions.


Amartya (Bridge): That’s such an important point — AR isn’t just about numbers, it’s about relationships that keep the business running smoothly.


Amartya (Question): What role is technology — and especially AI — starting to play in your AR function?


Tracy (Answer): AI has changed the game — what used to take hours in spreadsheets can now be flagged in minutes with predictive analytics.


Tracy (Answer): It helps us identify risky accounts early, which means fewer surprises and better conversations with customers.


Amartya (Question): Do you see ERP systems evolving to better support AR and credit teams?


Tracy (Answer): ERPs are the system of record, but their real power comes when you layer AI on top to drive insights and forecasting.


Tracy (Answer): The future is in smarter dashboards, real-time risk scoring, and decision support — not just static reporting.


Amartya (Question): What advice would you give to finance professionals looking to grow into AR leadership?


Tracy (Answer): Technical skills matter, but people skills matter more — emotional intelligence and empathy are what truly make you effective.


Tracy (Answer): Leadership is about relationships, influence, and helping your team succeed — not just closing the books.


Amartya (Closing): Tracy, thank you for sharing your journey and insights — it’s been fantastic having you on the podcast.

Amartya: "Mark has over two decades of experience leading credit, collections, and AR at firms like Evoque, IBM, NEC, Rexel, Samsung and more."


Amartya (Question): "Super pumped to dive deep into your journey across credit, collections, and AR."


Mark (Answer): "My journey wasn’t planned — I never thought I’d be in credit and collections, but I found my niche and loved it."


Amartya (Question): "At Trellix, you’ve seen both pre-COVID and post-COVID finance changes — how has that journey been for you?"


Mark (Answer): "At Trellix, the carve-out from McAfee was one of the most fast-paced, challenging times of my career."


Amartya (Question): "How has leading global teams across geographies worked out for you?"


Mark (Answer): "Leading global teams works best when you build trust through team-building, encouragement, and empathy."


Amartya (Question): "What has been your single biggest transformation project on the credit side and the collections side?"


Mark (Answer): "At Trellix, past dues were nearly 60%, but we reduced it to less than 10% within six months."


Mark (Answer): "At NEC, collections were 70% past due and cash flow was negative — within a year we turned it into +$40M free cash flow."


Amartya (Conclusion): "Collections is always a balancing act — push too hard and you hurt customer relationships, push too little and cash flow suffers."


Mark (Answer): "You have to get executive management support, otherwise sales will push back and you can’t enforce credit policy effectively."


Mark (Answer): "High-visibility customers need careful handling — sometimes you need executives to step in and collect."


Amartya (Question): "How do you see ERPs and AI shaping the future of credit, collections and AR?"


Mark (Answer): "ERPs have always lacked in credit and collections — it’s always been an afterthought, and I don’t understand why."


Mark (Answer on AI): "AI is going to disrupt everything — it makes decisions faster and removes repetitive work, freeing teams for higher-value tasks."


Mark (Closing Insight): "Transparency, empathy, and hiring smart have kept my turnover at Trellix to zero over the last three years."


Amartya (Closing): "Mark, your journey across industries and your ability to lead global teams with empathy while driving transformation is truly inspiring. Thank you for sharing such valuable insights with us today."

      transcript: `Amartya Singh: Welcome to Inside the CFO Office. Today’s guest is Josh Rappoport, VP of Finance at Acumatica. With a background in private equity, venture capital, and SaaS, Josh brings a rare dual lens of investor and operator.
Josh Rappoport: I like to say I did my career backwards - starting as an investor before moving into finance leadership. At the core of it all is curiosity. I’ve always been fascinated by how businesses actually work, not just from a high-level view but deep into operations.
Amartya: You’ve led finance across fast-growing SaaS companies. What are your top priorities today?
Josh: First is GTM efficiency - understanding bookings and driving predictable revenue. Second, resourcing - aligning people to growth plans. And third, delivery cost - especially as AI changes software delivery. We need to understand these new cost structures deeply.
Amartya: You’ve worked both in an ERP company and with ERP customers. How has that shaped your finance philosophy?
Josh: Finance is no longer just about numbers - it’s about understanding the activity behind them. The job is to partner with the business, translate operational realities into financial insight, and communicate them in a language everyone understands.
Amartya: You said something that stuck - finance as the “Rosetta Stone” of the business.
Josh: Exactly. A great finance team translates between functions - engineering, marketing, sales - so the whole business speaks the same strategic language.
Amartya: Let’s talk about CFOTech. You sit inside a leading ERP firm - how do you see the tech stack evolving?
Josh: Tech is a tool. AI is a sharper tool. But without strong foundational understanding - what I call the “shoulders” to wield the tool - it’s ineffective. We can’t skip training the next generation by letting AI handle all the entry-level thinking. That would be a mistake.
Amartya: That’s a bold and thoughtful take. Last question - what advice do you have for finance professionals aiming to lead?
Josh: Three things:
Stay curious. “I don’t know” is the best starting point.
Communicate. Telling the story behind the numbers is more powerful than just showing the numbers.
Understand your stakeholders. Great finance strategy starts with understanding what people really want.

Amartya: Loved this conversation, Josh. Thanks for sharing your story and perspectives with us.
Josh: Thanks for having me. Conversations like this help me reflect and grow too.

His journey is anything but traditional — starting in cold-calling sales before moving into finance leadership roles spanning collections, procurement, deal desk, and revenue operations.
Jason Wooten: I started in BDR roles — literally cold-calling from a printed directory. That experience taught me resilience, focus, and execution, which I carried with me across roles. As I moved into operations and eventually into finance, I found myself always collaborating with finance teams. The transition felt natural.
Amartya: One of your toughest and most rewarding experiences was in cash collections. What stood out?
Jason: Cash collections is all about cross-functional collaboration. The biggest mistake companies make is treating it as a silo. To do it well, you need deep context from sales, customer success, and service teams. Most disputes aren’t about money — they’re about product gaps, unmet expectations, or poor communication. You can’t solve those without understanding the full customer journey.
Amartya: That’s a powerful insight — balancing logo vs. cash retention is always tough. You also led a major office relocation. Tell us more.
Jason: That was a 2-year project — finding off-market space, negotiating the lease, securing government incentives, and overseeing construction. I had zero experience in real estate or project management. It was overwhelming, but transformative. My biggest learning? Say yes to the rocket ship, even if you’re not sure which seat you’re in.
Amartya: Let’s talk about transformation. Any standout projects?
Jason: At Cvent, we launched a customer payment processing solution. Initially simple, but as scale increased, the cracks showed. Years later, we had to completely rebuild it — and more importantly, rethink how finance engages with customers. Finance is usually not seen as customer-facing, but when it comes to money, perception matters. This transformation changed how both customers and internal teams viewed the finance function.
Amartya: Speaking of change — what’s your view on the current CFO tech landscape?
Jason: It’s outdated. Finance systems are sticky, underinvested, and stale. There’s a huge gap between platforms and point solutions. No one’s building an intelligent, connected platform that uses AI meaningfully across finance. AI vendors either solve tiny problems or provide clunky models that are hard to price and even harder to forecast. Legal risk and pricing complexity slow down adoption in bigger companies.
Amartya: Totally agree — the future is connected data and agentic AI across finance workflows. Final question — what advice do you have for aspiring finance leaders?
Jason: First, lead yourself. Know your motivations, take care of your health and routines. Second, own your career. No one else is responsible for your growth. Third, prioritize people. Every business problem has a people dimension — finance leaders can’t ignore that. And finally, raise your hand for big, uncomfortable challenges. That’s where real growth happens.

      transcript: `Amartya Singh: Welcome to Inside the CFO Office, an exclusive series for finance professionals and leaders. In this episode, we explore how the Controller role is transforming into a true leadership function — and I'm thrilled to be joined by Alex MacGillivray, VP Finance at Clio.
Alex has had a fascinating journey, from Deloitte to Easy Markit and now Clio, where he's helped the company scale through hypergrowth, multiple acquisitions, and a record-breaking $900M Series F funding. Welcome, Alex.
Alex MacGillivray: Thanks, Amartya. Happy to be here.
Amartya: Let's start with your journey. You've moved from audit at Deloitte to leading finance at one of Canada's top SaaS companies. What were some defining moments?
Alex: I started at Deloitte around the 2008 financial crisis. I didn't know exactly what I wanted, so audit gave me exposure to everything — oil & gas, a silver mine in Guatemala, even an aboriginal government in Northern Canada. Over time, I realized I wanted to work in tech. I joined a small dental tech startup where I was a finance team of one — that taught me a lot about operations. Then I went back to Deloitte, but this time focused on software clients. Eventually, Clio came along — and it's been a rocket ship ever since.
Amartya: And today, you lead a team of 60. That's a big scale-up. What's been your biggest learning?
Alex: Leadership is about values. We've grown from a 5-person team to over 60, and the only way to scale effectively is by being clear about what you stand for. My three core values are: excellence, integrity, and empathy. Excellence means doing things the right way. Integrity means no shortcuts. Empathy reminds us that we're all human — and we support each other through tough times. These values help us build a high-performance team that works in sync.
Amartya: That's powerful. Let's shift to the Controller role. What are the top priorities for Controllers in today's world?
Alex: First — documentation and accuracy. For example, years ago we ran a one-time pricing incentive that skewed revenue numbers. We kept meticulous records. During our Series F due diligence, that documentation helped us recover value and boost our valuation. That one spreadsheet could be worth hundreds of millions today.
 Second — relationships. You need deep touchpoints with leaders across sales, marketing, product. Finance can’t advise without understanding the business.
 Third — storytelling. The best Controllers help the business understand itself through numbers. It’s not just about accuracy, it’s about context. And yes, AI can help here — I use Gemini and ChatGPT to turn raw data into insights and trends.
Amartya: That’s a great segue — what’s your take on today’s CFO tech stacks? Can AI really make a difference?
Alex: The opportunity is huge, but the landscape is stuck. Most ERPs are operating like it’s still 2005 — outdated UI, rigid workflows, expensive licenses. We’re desperate for modern tools. Where I see potential is in transaction-heavy areas like AP, AR, and expense categorization.
 Last year alone, we posted over 6 million journal entries. That’s a massive data set AI can learn from. I’m hopeful — but the disruption will only happen if vendors can build tools that actually work across real-world complexity.
Amartya: Totally agree. At FinFloh, we’ve seen that as well — especially when using LLMs for real-time AR workflows. If finance teams can trust the system to triage, trigger workflows, or even respond to customer queries — that’s a game-changer.
Alex: Exactly. But the key is always clean, contextual data. Without that, AI is just another shiny object.
Amartya: One final question — what advice would you give to finance professionals stepping into leadership?
Alex: Three things:
 First, curiosity. When something looks odd, investigate it. That’s where real insight lies.
 Second, seize your moment. Jason Lemkin once said: “Once or twice in life, you get an opportunity you don’t deserve. Work 100 hours and make it happen.” Clio was that for me.
 Third, define your leadership values. Most people can’t name theirs. But once you do, everything gets clearer — hiring, decision-making, culture. That’s how you build a team that’s an extension of yourself.
Amartya: Couldn’t agree more. And I loved your line: “The best Controllers help the business understand itself through numbers.” That says it all.
Alex: Thanks, Amartya. This was a great conversation.

      transcript: `Amartya Singh: Welcome to Episode 14 of Inside the CFO Office. Today, we're diving into the evolving role of CFOs as strategic co-pilots to CEOs. Joining me is Jeff Pollack, a seasoned finance executive with experience at IOHK and now an advisor to the Hoskinson Family Office. Welcome, Jeff!

Jeff Pollack: Thanks, Amartya. Great to be here. Quick update—while I was the CFO at IOHK, I've since transitioned to advise the Hoskinson Family Office, which I also helped set up.

Amartya: That's awesome! Your career spans investment banking, capital markets, controllership, and now strategic finance in Web3. Can you walk us through your journey?

Jeff: Sure! I started out as an auditor, then moved into the analyst role, which gave me the opportunity to work in liquidity risk at Salomon Brothers. That was a turning point—it shaped how I think about finance. Over time, I moved into FP&A, then controllership roles, and ultimately became a CFO. I've worked across traditional finance and the blockchain space. And the common theme has always been using data and insights to drive better business decisions.

Amartya: So your background in tech and data really set you up for success as a modern CFO?

Jeff: Definitely. My computer science training helped me translate numbers into meaningful business stories. That ability to distill complex data into a narrative that executives can act on—it's been one of the most important skills in my journey.

Amartya: That's powerful. You've often talked about the CFO as a co-pilot. What does that role look like in practice?

Jeff: It means being more than just the "numbers guy." As a CFO, you're helping shape strategy, asking questions like: "Is this the best use of capital?" or "Are we investing in the right areas for growth?" You're the one who sees across the company, connecting financial outcomes to operational drivers. You're side-by-side with the CEO helping steer the ship.

Amartya: That shift must require major transformation inside the finance function, right?

Jeff: Absolutely. You need the right people, systems, and processes. At IOHK, we built everything from scratch: brought in NetSuite, designed custom automations, and integrated FP&A tools. But tools alone don't solve problems—people do. You need a strong controller, FP&A team, and business analysts who can partner with other functions.

Amartya: Speaking of tools—what are the gaps you see in the CFOTech stack today?

Jeff: Many finance systems are still siloed. You've got GLs in one place, budgeting tools somewhere else, and analytics in spreadsheets. That fragmentation kills insights. You need connected data flows if you want to make real-time decisions or apply AI. And most companies haven't gotten there yet.

Amartya: Let's talk about AI. Hype or reality?

Jeff: It's both. There's a lot of noise, but also real value. For example, using AI to generate baseline forecasts from historicals? Totally doable today. Automating reconciliations or surfacing anomalies? Also possible. But finance isn't plug-and-play yet. You need clean data and solid infrastructure first.

Amartya: Any advice for finance leaders looking to explore AI?

Jeff: Start small. Experiment in areas with clean data—like expense analysis or revenue forecasting. And bring your team along for the journey. AI won't replace finance pros, but finance pros who use AI will outperform those who don't.

Amartya: Great insight. Let's wrap up with your advice for the next generation of CFOs.

Jeff: Three things:

Master communication—speak the language of the business, not just finance.

Embrace tech—but stay grounded in fundamentals.

Build great teams—people drive transformation, not platforms.

Amartya: Jeff, this was an incredible conversation. Thank you for sharing your journey and insights!

Jeff: Thanks, Amartya. Always happy to contribute to the CFO community.

Amartya: And thank you to all our listeners. See you next time on Inside the CFO Office.`,

      transcript: `Amartya Singh: Welcome to Episode 13 of Inside the CFO Office. Today, we're exploring the fine balance a CFO must strike between finance and operations. Joining me is Alexander Freeman, CFO at Wursta, with prior leadership roles at Visa, Dell, HID Global, American Express, and Diebold. Alex has built high-performance teams across the U.S., Europe, and emerging markets. Welcome, Alex!
Alexander Freeman: Thanks, Amartya. I'm excited to be here. Always glad to share and give back to the community.
Amartya: Your journey spans risk, controllership, and now global finance leadership. What moments stand out?
Alex: One early moment was during my MBA at Purdue—Citigroup invited me to a recruitment event in Orlando but didn't cover expenses. My mentor told me, "You've got to go. It's an investment." I did—and that led to my first job. From there, I took every opportunity: Moscow, sales ops, credit risk. My path hasn't been linear, but each role built on the last. My advice? Never close doors. Stay open to conversations—you can't plan everything.
Amartya: That's such a powerful outlook. Let's talk about your current role at Wursta. What's it been like leading finance at a fast-growing firm?
Alex: I joined at a transitional point. Wursta was growing fast and needed to mature its finance function. That meant hiring the right people—a strong controller, nearshore FP&A and accounting support, and a staff accountant for day-to-day operations. We also moved from QuickBooks to NetSuite. People are everything. Good hires made it all possible.
Amartya: And now your team's supporting sales ops too?
Alex: Exactly. Because of my sales ops background, we've been able to support pipeline forecasting, sales comp, and customer segmentation. Cross-functional work is easier when finance understands operations.
Amartya: That brings us to a key theme: finance and operations. You've operated at their intersection—how do you balance the two?
Alex: You start by understanding the business. Spend time with ops leaders. Identify what drives the P&L. Build relationships with the people behind those levers. It's not linear—it's a complex system. But if you learn it and cultivate trust, you become a true business partner.
Amartya: Great perspective. How do you think about tech stacks today?
Alex: There's too much noise—so many tools claiming to solve everything. My advice: don't rush. Define your needs, test with your own data, and evaluate ROI up front. We evaluated sales comp tools for two years and stayed with Excel because it was more flexible. New tech is only helpful if it actually works for you.
Amartya: You mentioned testing with real data. We do the same at FinFloh. It's crucial for adoption. Let's talk AI—how are you experimenting there?
Alex: We're a Google reseller, so we use Gemini across the company. It's part of daily workflows. I'm also meeting AI vendors to understand their value propositions. If someone claims 70% cost reduction—I'm curious. We're not at a plug-and-play stage in finance yet, but it's evolving fast.
Amartya: What's your view on AI adoption globally?
Alex: From what I see, early adoption is happening faster outside the U.S., especially in places like Russia and Ukraine where prompt engineers are already in high demand. The legal field has Harvey—accounting will get its own version soon. We're not there yet, but it's coming.
Amartya: Let's close with advice for the next generation of finance leaders.
Alex: Three things:
Keep learning—but don't expect it all from school. Find mentors, books, and experiences that push you.

Build partnerships. Help others succeed and you'll grow too.

Stay on the edge of what's next. Whether it's tech or trends—curiosity is your superpower.

Amartya: Couldn't agree more. And I really appreciated your customer-first mindset—understanding what they value and tailoring finance strategies to support that. It's rare and incredibly valuable.
Alex: Thanks, Amartya. I really enjoyed the conversation—it helped me reflect and learn too.
Amartya: Thanks for joining, Alex. And thanks to everyone for tuning in. See you on the next episode of Inside the CFO Office.`,

      transcript: `Amartya: Welcome to Episode 12 of Inside the CFO Office. Today's conversation is about getting financial transformation right, working across industries, and how modern CFOs are thinking about tech and AI. And I couldn't think of a better person to join us than Scott, CFO and Corporate Secretary at Plurilock. Scott, great to have you here.
Scott: Thanks, Amartya. Happy to be here.
Amartya: Let's kick things off with your journey. You started out in finance and moved across some very diverse industries. How did that evolve?
Scott: I started straight into industry after school, not the audit route. I joined Schneider Electric and got to see every part of finance—accounting, consolidations, FP&A, and business partnering. That last piece was huge. It taught me that finance isn't just about numbers—it's about understanding how the business really works. You can't be a strategic CFO without knowing how your company makes money.
Amartya: That's a great point. And business partnering early on really sets the foundation. Now, let's talk about transformation. You've led multiple ones. What stands out?
Scott: At Plurilock, we pivoted from being a pure software firm to offering cybersecurity services. That meant restructuring costs, integrating acquisitions, and setting up shared services. We had to move fast, clean up the back office, and do it all with a lean team. Another example—early in my career, I joined an FP&A team that struggled with forecasting. People were working late into the night every cycle. I took a step back, mapped out the process end to end, automated what I could, and enforced accountability. We went from 3AM submissions to finishing by noon. That taught me that transformation doesn't always need to be massive—small process fixes can be just as powerful.
Amartya: I love that. And I think a lot of finance professionals underestimate the value of micro-transformations. When you led the pivot at Plurilock, how did you manage the alignment across stakeholders?
Scott: Culture plays a big role. At Plurilock, we're entrepreneurial—we get things done. So there wasn't much resistance. But in larger orgs, you've got to bring people along. The hard part isn't the execution—it's the alignment. And the truth is, if you're not evolving your business, you're falling behind. The pace of tech change demands continuous transformation, not one-and-done efforts.
Amartya: Absolutely. And your career's been anything but one-dimensional. You've worked in gaming, cannabis, energy, cybersecurity. That's a lot of switching. What's your approach when entering a new industry?
Scott: I look at two things: first, are there any accounting specifics I need to learn—like biological assets in cannabis, which was wild. Second, how does this business make money? Once I understand the revenue model, I can plug in my finance skills. Every industry has its quirks, but the core finance principles stay the same. And over time, you start seeing patterns. A nuclear services firm and an HVAC business may look different on the surface, but they both run on service economics.
Amartya: That's a really practical lens. Let's shift to technology—how do you think about your CFO tech stack today?
Scott: I've learned the hard way—alignment is more important than perfection. It's better to have a decent system that everyone uses consistently than five great ones that no one touches. So I focus on tools that are simple, scalable, and integrate well with our existing stack. Flexibility is key, especially around pricing and user access. I always ask: how hard is it to pull data out? Can we hook this into other systems? And yes—it has to play well with Excel. No matter how many tools you buy, Excel's not going anywhere.
Amartya: It never does. And we're in a time where AI is starting to creep into all these tools. How do you see AI playing out in finance?
Scott: We're still in the early innings. My general advice? Use AI first. Instead of Googling or asking around, just throw it into a prompt and see what comes back. I've used it to draft legal clauses, write job descriptions, even spin up internal processes. I've seen friends use transcripts from meetings to auto-generate SOPs. These are small things, but they save hours. Over time, AI won't be optional—it'll just be part of how we work. Like email or Excel.
Amartya: Couldn't agree more. The trick is taking a step back and asking, "Is there a better way to do this?" That's often where automation or AI fits in. But it's hard when you're deep in execution mode.
Scott: That's where focus comes in. I always tell people—spend 30 minutes a week thinking about how you work, not just what you're working on. That's strategy. One of my first jobs in accounting, we were reconciling intercompany manually—printing things out, crossing them with pens. It took four hours. I dropped it into Excel and sorted it in five minutes. That's the kind of thinking people need to practice.
Amartya: Love that. Let's wrap up with some advice. For someone early in their finance career, what are two or three things they should focus on?
Scott: First—build your skill stack. And I don't just mean technical skills. Learn how to negotiate, communicate, manage emotions. Those are critical as you move into leadership. Second—wherever you are, do your job well, then ask for more. That's how you grow. You either get promoted or you build a stronger resume. And finally—know where you want to go. If your goal is to become a CFO, look at job descriptions and reverse-engineer the skills you need. Then go after them.
Amartya: That's gold. And I especially love the point about emotional intelligence. Finance interacts with every team—sales, ops, tech, HR. The pressure's high and emotions are real. You've got to learn how to manage that energy.
Scott: Exactly. Emotions drive decisions—yours and others'. If you can manage that well, you're already ahead.
Amartya: Brilliant conversation, Scott. Thanks so much for sharing your journey and perspective. Tons of actionable takeaways here for finance professionals at every stage.
Scott: Thanks, Amartya. I really enjoyed it.`,

Today, I'm joined by Gary Lu, a seasoned CFO with expertise in public company finance, strategic transformations, and operational excellence. He has led finance teams at Biomerica, Happy Money, Warp Technology, First Service Residential, and Broadcom, driving strategy, compliance, and growth.
Gary is also passionate about mentorship and founded Forge Optima, a network dedicated to advancing finance professionals through collaboration and learning. Today, we'll discuss CFO leadership at public firms—strategy, scale, and AI—and how finance leaders navigate growth, compliance, and financial scale while embracing AI and automation.
Welcome, Gary. Great to have you here.
Gary: Thanks, Amartya. Excited to be here!
Amartya: Let's start with your career journey. You've worked across consulting and finance leadership. How did your path evolve from EY to becoming a CFO?
Gary: Yeah, great question. I'd say my journey started in a pretty traditional way, but like most finance executives, there were twists and turns that helped me grow. I studied economics and accounting at UCLA, then went through EY's mentorship and internship program before transitioning into a full-time role.
Client service was great, but I wanted to be embedded in a company—understanding the products, working cross-functionally, and contributing beyond just finance. Tech was always something I was drawn to, so I joined Broadcom, where I started in SOX and IT audits. That experience opened doors for me.
I went through a corporate rotation—working in accounting, finance, business unit product finance, and strategic consulting. But the real game-changer was leading the PMO for a major SAP implementation, overseeing sales finance and business intelligence. That was the first time I really understood how finance, tech, and operations connect at a deep level.
From there, I moved into mid-market and public company finance, growing through different roles. But I had this itch—I had experience in enterprise and public finance, but I wanted to understand startups. How do companies start? What's it like from zero to Series D? That led me to Happy Money, where I was part of the journey from a lower valuation to a unicorn.
At Biomerica, I found the perfect blend—it's a public company but also has an emerging commercialization phase, like a startup within an established business. That mix of R&D, product commercialization, and public finance is what really attracted me to the role.
Amartya: That's fascinating. I love how you've navigated both structured enterprise finance and the fast-paced startup world. You also mentioned data architecture and tech stacks, which is rare in finance leadership. Most CFOs leave that to IT. What pushed you to get deeper into technology?
Gary: It really started when I was leading the SAP implementation at Broadcom. Up until that point, I understood financial models, accounting, and business operations, but I didn't fully appreciate how data flows across an organization.
Being at the center of an ERP rollout forced me to understand data architecture, system integrations, and end-to-end finance workflows. That gave me a completely different perspective—finance isn't just about numbers, it's about how information moves, how decisions are made, and how automation can eliminate inefficiencies.
I think this is where many finance leaders struggle. We're often seen as the "no" people—the gatekeepers, the ones setting financial guardrails. But in today's environment, that mindset can be limiting. The best CFOs embrace technology and look for ways to leverage AI, automation, and SaaS solutions to improve efficiency.
ERP implementations, for example, can be extremely expensive and time-consuming. But today, SaaS solutions allow you to solve specific problems without committing to a full-scale ERP overhaul. That kind of agility is something every finance leader should be thinking about.
Amartya: Completely agree. The role of finance is evolving fast, and CFOs who don't embrace technology risk falling behind. Now, let's talk about public vs. startup finance leadership. You've worked in both—what are the biggest differences?
Gary: Public companies and startups operate with completely different mindsets. In public firms, there's a huge focus on regulatory compliance, SEC filings, and investor relations. Managing shareholder expectations, preparing earnings calls, and ensuring transparency are all critical.
Startups, on the other hand, are all about agility, execution, and scaling fast. You're wearing multiple hats—sometimes you're the CFO, strategist, operator, and data analyst all in one. You rely more on SaaS tools instead of complex enterprise systems, and you have more freedom to innovate.
That said, the best CFOs know how to blend both mindsets—bringing financial discipline to startups and agility to public firms.
Amartya: That's a great breakdown. Speaking of finance systems, let's talk about ERPs vs. SaaS solutions. What's your take?
Gary: ERPs are powerful but rigid, expensive, and time-consuming to implement. You can customize them endlessly, but every customization adds cost and complexity. If you're not ready to invest millions into an ERP, it can become a bottleneck instead of an enabler.
SaaS solutions, on the other hand, are modular, cost-effective, and deploy quickly. In the past, SaaS tools solved specific, isolated problems, but now they're expanding into end-to-end solutions. For example, a SaaS product might start with AP automation, but then grow into procure-to-pay, credit risk management, or cash forecasting.
This shift is important because finance teams don't always need a massive ERP overhaul—sometimes, plugging in the right SaaS tool can solve the problem faster and more efficiently.

Amartya: That makes a lot of sense. Now, let’s talk about AI in finance. How do you see AI changing the game?
That said, many finance teams are still hesitant to adopt AI. Some worry about losing control, others assume automation will replace finance roles. But the truth is, AI doesn't replace CFOs—it enhances decision-making, reduces manual effort, and allows teams to focus on strategy instead of busywork.
Amartya: Couldn't agree more. AI is an enabler, not a replacement. Before we wrap up, what's your advice for finance professionals looking to advance their careers?

He’s known for driving financial discipline, building high-performing teams, and serving as a trusted advisor to CEOs.

Subodh has led finance teams across fintech, payments, e-commerce, and marketplaces, bringing a unique blend of strategic foresight and execution expertise. I’ve had some great conversations with him on the role of finance leaders in today’s rapidly changing world. In this episode, we’ll explore his journey from finance manager to CFO, the key differences between startups and enterprises, and how AI and predictive intelligence are reshaping financial leadership.

So let’s dive in. Welcome, Subodh! Happy to have you with us.

Amartya: Let's start with your career journey. You've moved through multiple finance leadership roles, from Fortune 200 firms to high-growth startups. What have been the biggest turning points in your career?

Amartya: Let’s start with your career journey. You’ve moved through multiple finance leadership roles, from Fortune 200 firms to high-growth startups. What have been the biggest turning points in your career?

Subodh: It’s been a fascinating journey. Over the last 20 years, I’ve worked across companies of all sizes, spanning different growth stages, industries, and economic cycles. I’ve had the opportunity to work with exceptional leaders, manage world-class teams, and navigate global financial challenges.

But beyond crises, my most valuable learnings came from building finance teams, driving business transformation, and ensuring that finance is not just about reporting numbers—it's about enabling growth.

But beyond crises, my most valuable learnings came from building finance teams, driving business transformation, and ensuring that finance is not just about reporting numbers—it’s about enabling growth.

Amartya: That’s a fantastic perspective. Leading through uncertainty is a key skill for modern CFOs. Let’s talk about your experience at Common—your first CFO role at a venture-backed fintech startup. What were the biggest challenges you faced, and how did they shape your leadership approach?

The second challenge was fundraising in a shifting market. We had strong backing from our existing investors, but attracting new capital in a changing macro environment was tough. By late 2022, as interest rates climbed and venture funding dried up, we had to rethink our financial strategy. The lesson? A great CFO must be proactive—predicting when funding windows will close and ensuring the company is well-prepared.

Amartya: Absolutely! I can relate to that challenge—balancing VC expectations, growth trajectories, and capital strategy is never easy. Now, you've worked in both startups and large enterprises. What are the biggest differences in financial leadership between the two?

Amartya: Absolutely! I can relate to that challenge—balancing VC expectations, growth trajectories, and capital strategy is never easy. Now, you’ve worked in both startups and large enterprises. What are the biggest differences in financial leadership between the two?

1️⃣ Risk & Stability - Large corporations focus on stability, risk management, and long-term resilience, while startups thrive on agility, execution speed, and rapid scaling. Large companies weather crises better, while startups often face existential threats if capital runs dry.

2️⃣ Thinking vs. Doing - Enterprises have multiple layers of planning, strategic reviews, and incremental decision-making. Startups, on the other hand, operate in execution mode—testing, iterating, and scaling quickly.

3️⃣ Resources - Large firms have deep resources, established teams, and external consultants. In startups, finance leaders must wear multiple hats, get hands-on, and solve problems with limited resources.

Despite these differences, the core principles of finance leadership remain the same—driving value, managing risk, and ensuring financial discipline.

Amartya: That's a great breakdown. Now, let's talk about the future—specifically, financial technology. Are today's ERP systems meeting the needs of modern finance teams, or is there room for innovation?

Amartya: That’s a great breakdown. Now, let’s talk about the future—specifically, financial technology. Are today’s ERP systems meeting the needs of modern finance teams, or is there room for innovation?

Subodh: ERPs have come a long way, but they haven’t evolved beyond data collection and reporting. While systems like SAP, Oracle, and NetSuite do a good job at managing financial workflows, they lack automation, intelligence, and predictive capabilities.

Amartya: Completely agree! Predictive intelligence is the missing piece in finance tech today. That brings us to AI. How do you see AI transforming finance?

Subodh: AI will reshape financial processes across the board:

FP&A & Forecasting – AI can analyze historical trends, macroeconomic indicators, and market data to predict financial outcomes with greater accuracy.

Credit Risk & Compliance – AI models can assess creditworthiness, detect anomalies, and flag potential compliance risks in real-time.

Pricing Models – AI can dynamically adjust pricing strategies based on market conditions, demand patterns, and competitor data.

We're still early in AI's adoption, but as AI models become more sophisticated, finance teams will move from reporting numbers to shaping strategy.

We’re still early in AI’s adoption, but as AI models become more sophisticated, finance teams will move from reporting numbers to shaping strategy.

Amartya: That’s an exciting vision. Before we wrap up, what advice would you give to finance professionals looking to advance their careers?

1️⃣ Master the Fundamentals – You need to know your numbers inside out. Technical expertise is non-negotiable.
2️⃣ Be Business-Savvy – Understand how finance connects to operations, sales, and strategy. Finance doesn't exist in a vacuum.
3️⃣ Develop Leadership & Storytelling Skills – Finance leaders must translate numbers into compelling narratives for CEOs, investors, and stakeholders.

On a personal note, I’ve had some great discussions with Marc on multiple aspects of financial leadership. I’m excited for him to share his insights with all of you. So, welcome, Marc!
Marc: It's been quite a journey! I started in the 90s as a young banker in New York, covering the real estate industry. I had a great run there and never imagined leaving. But in the late 90s, during the dot-com boom, I was working on a deal in San Francisco, and the energy of the tech community was infectious. I realized I was deeply familiar with traditional businesses but missing out on the tech revolution. So, in 2000, I took a leap and moved to San Francisco—a turning point that reshaped my career.
Amartya: Let’s kick off your career journey. You’ve had a fascinating transition—from investment banking to leading finance at a global tech company. What were the key moments that shaped your path?
Marc: It’s been quite a journey! I started in the 90s as a young banker in New York, covering the real estate industry. I had a great run there and never imagined leaving. But in the late 90s, during the dot-com boom, I was working on a deal in San Francisco, and the energy of the tech community was infectious. I realized I was deeply familiar with traditional businesses but missing out on the tech revolution. So, in 2000, I took a leap and moved to San Francisco—a turning point that reshaped my career.
At the same time, we started scaling our B2C business, Glance, a Gen AI-powered platform embedded in 400+ million mobile phones and smart TVs globally. Today, InMobi is a top 10 internet platform by audience reach—a remarkable journey that has been both challenging and rewarding.
That’s when I joined InMobi in 2018 at a critical inflection point. The company had already built a scaled B2B mobile advertising business, and over the next few years, we platformized our advertising business, making it more predictable. Today, our software is embedded in 50,000+ apps, reaching over 2 billion users globally.
Marc: One defining moment came during my first week on the job. I was in Bangalore, speaking with the CEO of a business we had just acquired, and he said, "We thought you were setting up payroll. You thought we were setting up payroll. Now, you own it, and you have a day to get our employees paid." That moment shifted my mindset completely—I wasn't just an advisor anymore. I had thousands of employees and their families depending on me.
That weight of responsibility has never left me. Being a CFO isn’t just about numbers—it’s about people. At InMobi, we run a global business across 19 offices, solving different problems every day, across different time zones. It’s a 24/7 role, but it has been incredibly fulfilling.
Amartya: That’s a great perspective. The human side of finance leadership is often overlooked, but it’s one of the most critical aspects. Speaking of leadership, you’ve handled finance functions in both the U.S. and India. What key differences have you observed?
Marc: India’s growth story is remarkable. Before joining InMobi, I didn’t fully grasp the scale of tech innovation happening in India. With a rapidly growing middle class, strong education system, and deep tech talent pool, India today reminds me of early-2000s China, when its tech ecosystem was on the verge of global breakout.
One big difference I noticed was meeting culture—U.S. meetings are often short and agenda-driven, while Indian meetings tend to be longer and highly in-depth. At InMobi, we balance both approaches—we send pre-reads to maximize efficiency but also allow deep problem-solving discussions. This approach has been key to solving complex challenges and driving innovation.
Amartya: That’s a great insight! Now, let’s talk about AI in finance—a major topic of discussion lately. How is InMobi leveraging AI in finance operations?
Marc: AI is at the core of everything we do—not just in our products but also in internal finance operations. We’ve automated most of our core finance processes, cleaned legacy databases, and built a centralized data lake on Databricks. This allows us to run real-time analytics and predictive insights for decision-making.
The next big leap? Agentic AI—AI that autonomously interacts with external systems to handle collections, reconciliations, and anomaly detection. Right now, finance professionals spend a disproportionate amount of time on edge cases. If AI can automate 80–95% of repetitive work, it will allow teams to focus on high-impact, strategic decisions.
Amartya: Completely agree! We at FinFloh believe Agentic AI is the future of CFO tech. AI won’t replace finance professionals, but it will augment their capabilities, helping them make faster, smarter decisions.
As we wrap up, what advice would you give to aspiring finance professionals looking to grow in this evolving landscape?
Marc: The finance profession is changing rapidly. The days of succeeding as just a technical finance practitioner are over. Future finance leaders must develop business context, AI skills, and embrace change. Finance teams are uniquely positioned to lead transformation because they touch every part of the business.
Amartya: That’s great advice! Marc, it’s been a pleasure having you on the podcast. Thanks for sharing your journey and insights!
Marc: Thanks, Amartya! I’ve enjoyed this conversation and hope the listeners do too.
Amartya: Thanks, everyone, for tuning in! Stay tuned for our next episode. Until then, take care and stay curious!`,

      transcript: `Amartya Singh: Hello everyone! I'm your host, Amartya Singh, Co-founder and CEO of FinFloh, a product built by and for modern finance teams. Welcome to the eighth episode of Inside the CFO Office, an exclusive platform where finance professionals gain insights into the journeys of finance leaders—their biggest challenges, lessons learned, and the evolving landscape of finance.
In today’s episode, we dive into the role of a CFO in growth beyond Series A with Jon Gross, CFO at RepeatMD. Jon’s finance leadership spans multiple industries, from investment banking and private equity to health, manufacturing, and fintech. With more than 15 years of experience, he has been instrumental in guiding businesses through different growth stages, handling M&A, operations, data strategy, and financial leadership.
Currently, Jon leads finance at RepeatMD, an innovative platform that automates revenue generation for aesthetic and wellness practices. Previously, he has held finance leadership roles at Keem, Redesign Health, The Riverside Company, and Piper Jaffray. His vast experience across M&A, financial operations, and data-driven decision-making makes him a powerhouse of knowledge for today’s conversation.
So, welcome, Jon! I’m excited to dive into your journey and perspectives.
Jon Gross: Thanks, Amartya! I appreciate the opportunity to be here. This is a topic that’s close to my heart, and I’m excited to jump in.
Amartya Singh: Let’s start with your career journey. You’ve transitioned from investment banking to CFO roles in high-growth startups. What were the defining moments that shaped your path?
Jon Gross: Absolutely! My journey started in investment banking and private equity, where I worked on high-stakes deals, capital raising, and M&A. However, over time, I felt the urge to move beyond transactions and build something from the inside. That led me to operational finance roles, M&A strategy, and eventually, CFO leadership.
At RepeatMD, we help aesthetic and wellness practices scale their revenue by creating their own branded mobile apps, complete with rewards programs, memberships, treatment packages, and patient financing options through our partnership with Affirm. In essence, we enable practices to engage with patients beyond their office visits, driving loyalty and business growth.
Amartya Singh: That’s fascinating! Having worked across startups and enterprises, what would you say are the key differences in how CFOs operate in these environments?
Jon Gross: Great question! The CFO role varies dramatically between startups and large enterprises.
Enterprises focus on stability, compliance, and long-term financial planning. The role is structured, with robust FP&A processes, risk mitigation, and regulatory focus.
Startups, on the other hand, operate in a high-growth, execution-driven environment. The CFO must balance cash flow management, investor relations, and scaling operations—all while navigating uncertainty.
I love working in Series A and beyond because it’s the right mix of product-market fit and the challenge of building for scale. It’s an exciting phase where financial leadership directly influences growth and company trajectory.
Amartya Singh: That brings me to the next question—how do you see the CFO’s role evolving as a company scales beyond Series A?
Jon Gross: The role evolves significantly as the company grows. At Series A, the CFO is deeply involved in cash flow management, budgeting, and ensuring financial discipline. As the company moves to Series B and beyond, the focus shifts towards strategic investments, scaling revenue operations, and preparing for larger funding rounds or exits.
One of the biggest challenges is sequencing growth decisions—knowing when and how to invest rather than just saying ‘yes’ or ‘no’. It’s about balancing risk and opportunity to fuel long-term success.
Amartya Singh: That’s a great insight. Speaking of strategy, let’s talk about financial systems and automation. How are you leveraging technology at RepeatMD?
Jon Gross: We’re in the midst of a major financial systems upgrade—migrating from QuickBooks to NetSuite and integrating Salesforce CPQ. Our goal is to create a streamlined, data-driven financial ecosystem that reduces friction between sales, finance, and operations.
My philosophy? Fewer systems, fewer integration points. The more fragmented your financial stack, the harder it is to maintain data integrity and generate accurate insights.
Amartya Singh: That makes complete sense. AI and automation are transforming finance. What’s your take on AI’s role in financial operations?
Jon Gross: AI is going to be a game-changer for finance teams. From automating collections and reconciling transactions to predictive analytics and financial modeling, AI can significantly reduce manual workload and improve decision-making. However, we’re still in the early stages of its full potential.
The key is building a strong data foundation before layering AI on top. If your data isn’t clean and structured, AI-driven insights won’t be reliable.
Amartya Singh: That’s a great point. Before we wrap up, what advice would you give to finance professionals looking to step into CFO roles?
Jon Gross: A few things come to mind:
1️⃣ Develop range – Build expertise across finance, strategy, operations, and data analytics. The more problems you can solve, the more valuable you become.
2️⃣ Be proactive – Always come prepared with insights, not just numbers. A great CFO anticipates challenges and provides solutions before problems arise.
3️⃣ Embrace technology – AI, automation, and financial systems will shape the future of finance. Stay ahead by continuously learning and experimenting with new tools.
4️⃣ Enjoy the journey – Things won’t always go according to plan, but the learning and experiences along the way are what make the ride worthwhile.
Amartya Singh: That’s fantastic advice! Jon, it’s been a pleasure having you on the podcast. Thanks for sharing your insights and experiences.
Jon Gross: Thanks, Amartya! I really enjoyed this discussion. Looking forward to staying connected.
Amartya Singh: And to our listeners, thanks for tuning in to Episode 8 of Inside the CFO Office. Stay tuned for more thought-provoking conversations with finance leaders. Until next time, take care and stay curious!

      transcript: `Amartya: Hello everyone. I'm your host, Amartya Singh, co-founder and CEO of FinFloh, a product built by and for modern finance teams. Welcome back to the seventh episode of our podcast, Inside the CFO Office, an exclusive channel where finance professionals can learn from the journeys of finance leaders and trailblazers in the CFO space.
In each episode, we explore the biggest challenges they’ve faced, the innovative solutions they’ve developed, and their vision for the future of finance. Today, we're thrilled to welcome Chris McCort to share his extensive experience in finance and strategic leadership. His career spans over two decades across industries like technology, advertising, and real estate.
Chris has earned a reputation as a trusted advisor and leader in the C-suite. Currently the Chief Financial Officer at Bergmayer, he has consistently driven operational excellence, financial strategy, and sustainable growth at firms like Digilant, VaultLogix, LocatePlus, and others. Personally, I’ve had insightful discussions with Chris about finance strategy, processes, teams, and, my favorite, finance technologies. I’m thrilled to have him here today to share his journey and advice. Welcome, Chris!
Amartya: Great to have you with us.
Chris: Thank you so much! I’m really happy to be here and looking forward to another great conversation with you.
Amartya: Let’s dive right in. Your career journey is fascinating—starting as a staff accountant and rising to the role of CFO. That must have been quite the experience, filled with challenges and milestones. Could you share the key moments or turning points that shaped your journey and your overall experience? What got you here?
Chris: Absolutely. In college, I was an accounting major and thought I’d spend my career working with numbers, balancing books, and preparing financial statements. I started in public accounting but quickly realized auditing other companies’ books wasn’t for me—it lacked the dynamic challenges I was seeking.
An old college roommate offered me a job at LocatePlus, where I started at the bottom, working on accounts payable entries and learning how to use ERP systems. That foundational experience was invaluable, giving me real-world insight into accounting beyond the classroom.
Later, at VaultLogix, I had my first mentor, Tom Spencer, the CFO. He taught me how to think strategically—how to step beyond the basics of accounting and view the business from a 30,000-foot perspective. He entrusted me with leading audits and managing a team, which was transformative for my growth.
Then, at Digilant, I worked under two brilliant mentors: David Graña, the Global CFO based in Spain, and Todd Hager, the CRO. They demonstrated what it means to act like an executive—how to lead meetings, build teams, and mentor effectively. Their guidance helped me transition from being an accountant to a leader and strategist.
Amartya: Got it.
Chris: Finally, my role at Bergmayer over the past 18 months has been incredible. It’s been an opportunity to apply everything I’ve learned to lead a finance team that needed organization and strategic direction. We’ve become trusted advisors within the company, contributing significantly to growth and decision-making.
Amartya: That’s impressive! I noticed a few recurring themes—mentorship being a key one. Good mentors provide both guidance and a broader perspective, helping you think beyond numbers and into strategic territory. I loved the phrase you used, "30,000-foot view." Strategy and vision are critical for a CFO. In your experience, how important is having a clear strategy and vision, and how have you implemented these in your roles?
Chris: It’s essential. You can develop a strategy in collaboration with your CEO and other executives, but execution depends on having a team that’s aligned with your goals. Communication is at the heart of this. If you can communicate your vision effectively, your chances of success increase dramatically.
Amartya: Communication—I agree. Now, challenges are inevitable in any finance career. Out of all the obstacles you’ve faced, what are the top two challenges that stand out? How did you approach and overcome them?
Chris: Great question. The first challenge was stepping away from the technical accounting work to focus on strategic leadership. As a CFO, you must think about the entire business, not just debits and credits. That shift was a learning curve.
The second challenge was learning to manage people. You can’t do it all yourself—you need to trust your team. Managing effectively requires regular communication, clear expectations, and creating an environment where everyone is moving in the same direction.
Amartya: Absolutely. Managing people comes with its own complexities, especially when working across industries and with diverse teams. Can you share examples of how you handled these dynamics?
Chris: It’s tricky because people communicate and learn differently. Building trust is key. You spend a significant portion of your life with your colleagues, so balancing friendship with leadership is important. I’m firm about setting expectations, but I also avoid micromanaging—we’re all professionals. Clear communication is the cornerstone of effective management.
Amartya: That makes sense. You’ve also mentioned working hands-on with accounting software early in your career. Technology in accounting has evolved significantly. What’s your take on how accounting has changed over the years, and where do you see it headed?
Chris: The fundamentals of accounting haven’t changed much—it’s still about balancing debits and credits. However, regulations, audit requirements, and financial classifications continuously evolve. The real transformation is on the technology side. AI-driven ERP systems are making processes more efficient. At Bergmayer, we use Deltek Vantagepoint, which has AI capabilities. It’s exciting to see how AI will continue shaping finance by streamlining workflows and improving decision-making.
Amartya: Indeed! AI’s potential is immense. But there are risks too, especially with generative AI handling ledger entries. How do you see those risks, and how can they be mitigated?
Chris: The benefits of AI outweigh the risks, but guardrails are crucial. Finance operates within a well-defined framework, so AI can be programmed with strict parameters. However, AI might struggle with the nuances of "gray areas" in accounting. Implementing a maker-checker system where AI entries require human approval can balance efficiency and oversight.
Amartya: Excellent points. Speaking of technology, many accounting tools exist—from QuickBooks and Sage to enterprise solutions like SAP. Do you think there’s a need for a new, modern, AI-driven accounting software?
Chris: Absolutely. Many current ERPs feel outdated. I envision a unified dashboard where tasks can be executed with minimal clicks. Reporting and data analysis are areas where AI can add tremendous value, helping finance professionals interpret data and communicate insights more effectively.
Amartya: That’s insightful. Data management is crucial—clean data enables better decision-making. Let’s pivot to your CFO experiences at Digilant and Bergmayer. How did your role at Digilant prepare you for Bergmayer, and how has your philosophy as a finance leader evolved?
Chris: Digilant and Bergmayer are very different. Digilant was in ad tech, while Bergmayer is a creative firm. At Bergmayer, I’m surrounded by innovative, out-of-the-box thinkers, which has been refreshing. Across both roles, the core finance strategy remains the same—focusing on growth, efficiency, and maximizing profitability. A key lesson I’ve learned is that you can’t cut your way to success—growth requires investment in people, products, and services. Strategy is a living document that evolves, and success comes from continuous learning and team collaboration.
Amartya: I love that—strategy as a living, evolving guide. Successful leaders embrace challenges and see new experiences as learning opportunities. Finally, for finance professionals aspiring to leadership, what are your top pieces of advice?
Chris: First, don’t be afraid to fail. Mistakes are valuable learning opportunities. Second, treat people the way you want to be treated—build trust and avoid micromanaging. Third, say yes to opportunities outside your comfort zone. Every experience adds to your growth, even if it’s challenging.
Amartya: Fantastic insights, Chris. Thank you for sharing your journey and wisdom. It’s been a pleasure having you on the podcast.
Chris: Thank you, Amartya! This has been a great conversation—I’d happily chat all day.
Amartya: Likewise! Thanks to all our listeners for tuning in. Stay connected with us for more inspiring stories and insights from finance leaders. Until next time!

      transcript: `Amartya Singh: Hi, Alyssa.
Alyssa Schadinger: Hi, Amartya! How's it going?
Amartya Singh: All great. How is your day looking?
Alyssa Schadinger: Just getting started here on the East Coast. So far, so good.
Amartya Singh: Great, Alyssa. Thanks for joining the podcast. Hello everyone! I'm your host, Amartya Singh, co-founder and CEO of FinFloh, a product built by and for modern finance teams using AI and automation. We are back with the sixth episode of our podcast, Inside the CFO Office, an exclusive channel for finance professionals to learn about the journeys of finance leaders, the challenges they have faced and solved, and most importantly, their take on the future of finance.
In today's episode, we are super excited to have Alyssa Schadinger with us as a guest to share her journey. Alyssa is an MBA graduate from Wharton and holds a Bachelor's degree in Finance and Accounting from Stockton University. She has over a decade of experience in finance, accounting, strategy, and audit, having worked with companies of varying sizes and industries.
Currently, Alyssa serves as the CFO at Sisense, a leading embedded analytics platform. Prior to Sisense, she held various finance leadership roles at Akamai, Linode, Deloitte, and many other firms. As a CFO, she has worked across domains including business finance, AR, AP, FP&A, and controllership—all of which we’ll explore in today's podcast.
On a personal note, I’ve had some great discussions with Alyssa about the finance ecosystem, her experience with finance technology, and how her insights have helped shape use cases like credit risk scoring and accounts receivable automation for FinFloh. So, without further ado, let’s kickstart the podcast. Welcome, Alyssa!
Alyssa Schadinger: Thank you so much for that lovely introduction, Amartya. And thank you for having me on today. I’m really excited about our conversation.
Amartya Singh: Thanks, Alyssa. It’s a pleasure to have you here. Let’s dive right in. Your journey has been fascinating, moving from a corporate accounting intern to audit, and eventually to the CFO seat. It’s clear that your experience has been diverse and filled with challenges. How has your journey been so far?
Alyssa Schadinger: Well, I’d say it’s been a winding road to the CFO office. My first foray into accounting or finance was as an accounting intern when I was just 17 years old. It was through a school-to-careers program in high school, and I worked for a local telecom company. That experience was somewhat serendipitous because I initially planned to study psychology in college. However, this internship sparked an interest in business, so I decided to pursue finance and accounting instead.
In college, I particularly enjoyed taxation courses, but when it came time to start my career, the best offers I received were for audit roles. So, I joined WeiserMazars, a regional public accounting firm, as an auditor for about two years. Then came the first pivot in my career: I transitioned into business operations and internal audit consulting at Productivity. Over the next three years, I gained exposure to areas like supply chain management and regulatory compliance.
Later, I joined the Pine Hill Group and Deloitte, focusing on IPO readiness and M&A deal advisory projects. One of the most memorable projects I worked on was Takeda Pharmaceuticals' $50 billion acquisition of Shire Pharmaceuticals. It was incredible to see a deal of that magnitude and assist with listing Takeda publicly in the U.S.
Eventually, I moved into the tech space. I joined Linode, a growth-stage infrastructure-as-a-service company, as their corporate controller and was later promoted to oversee FP&A and BI. That experience was invaluable, as I helped the company scale and navigate a $900 million acquisition by Akamai Technologies. Following this, I joined Sisense as VP of Finance and, after about a year, was elevated to CFO. It’s been an incredible journey, filled with pivots and learnings.
Amartya Singh: That’s such a remarkable path, Alyssa. One thing that stands out is the variety in your roles—audit, consulting, controllership, and FP&A. As a CFO, you’ve worked across different dimensions of finance. For aspiring CFOs, how important is it to gain diverse experiences like these, and what skills or traits should they focus on developing?
Alyssa Schadinger: I think diverse experiences are essential. Early in my career, I had a mentor who advised me to get exposure across different areas of finance and accounting. It’s important to be a generalist who knows enough about different areas to ask the right questions and recruit strong team members to fill in gaps. You don’t need to be an expert in every domain, but you need to have a comprehensive understanding of how they connect and contribute to the bigger picture.
Curiosity and the willingness to ask questions are critical. I like to say you need to be "dangerous enough" to engage in meaningful discussions across tax, accounting, FP&A, and analytics. Beyond that, building strong teams is crucial. A good leader recognizes their strengths and weaknesses and surrounds themselves with people who can complement their skills.
Amartya Singh: I love that—being "dangerous enough" and fostering curiosity. It’s so important to have that holistic view and to connect the dots. Now, let’s shift gears a bit. You mentioned your involvement in M&A deals, including the $900 million Linode-Akamai transaction. What were your key takeaways from that experience, especially in terms of negotiations, integration, and cultural alignment?
Alyssa Schadinger: Great question. One key takeaway is the importance of being a storyteller. As a finance professional, you need to articulate the company’s strategy and financial story in a way that resonates with potential acquirers. You’re essentially explaining what makes the business successful and how a combined entity can achieve even greater success.
When it comes to negotiations, transparency is surprisingly effective. People often think negotiations are just about price, but in large deals, factors like culture and strategic fit matter just as much. For example, in the Linode-Akamai transaction, culture was a top priority for Linode’s founders. Akamai’s people-centric approach made them a perfect fit, and that alignment played a significant role in the success of the deal.
Integration is another critical aspect. Beyond the financials and systems, it’s about aligning people and processes. Culture clashes can derail even the most strategically sound deals, so it’s essential to address those challenges early.
Amartya Singh: Absolutely. Storytelling and cultural alignment are often overlooked but can make or break a deal. Let’s talk about finance technologies. You’ve worked with various tools—from ERP systems like NetSuite to expense management platforms. What’s your take on the build-versus-buy decision for finance software, and how do you approach it?
Alyssa Schadinger: The build-versus-buy decision depends on the company’s stage, complexity, and available resources. For instance, at Linode, we transitioned from QuickBooks to NetSuite to handle multi-entity, multi-currency operations. Given our lean team, we opted for off-the-shelf tools like Divvy for expense management and NextTravel for travel booking.
At Sisense, we already had a mature tech stack, including Salesforce, NetSuite, and Expensify. However, we streamlined operations by replacing Coupa and Expensify with Ramp, which offered significant cost savings and efficiency gains. Ultimately, the decision boils down to understanding your current needs, budget, and internal expertise.
Amartya Singh: That’s insightful. Before we wrap up, let’s touch on AI. How do you see AI shaping the future of finance, and have you implemented any AI-driven solutions at Sisense?
Alyssa Schadinger: AI is a game changer. At Sisense, we’ve built a finance chatbot using ChatGPT to provide quick access to financial insights. Our CEO, who is based in EMEA, can now query the chatbot for real-time data like top customers or revenue concentration by industry. This has reduced reliance on static reports and improved efficiency.
Looking ahead, we’re exploring ways to integrate our chatbot with Sisense’s data analytics platform for real-time updates. AI has immense potential to streamline processes, reduce errors, and enable more strategic decision-making in finance.
Amartya Singh: That’s fascinating. Alyssa, thank you for sharing your journey and insights. It’s been a pleasure having you on the podcast.
Alyssa Schadinger: Thank you, Amartya. It’s been a great conversation. To all the listeners, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or check out Sisense for cutting-edge analytics and insights. I just want to say thank you again for having me on the podcast.
Amartya Singh: Thank you so much, Elisa, for joining us on today's podcast. And a big thank you to all our listeners for tuning in. We hope this episode has added value to your understanding of what you can expect in your future and what steps you need to take moving forward. Stay tuned for the next episode, and once again, thank you for being with us.
Take care, and goodbye!

      transcript: `Amartya Singh: Hello everyone! I'm your host, Amartya Singh, co-founder and CEO of FinFlow, a product built by and for modern finance teams. We are back with the fifth episode of our podcast series, Inside the CFO Office, an exclusive channel for finance professionals to learn more about the journeys of finance leaders and trailblazers in the CFO office.
In today's episode, we focus on the need for CFO leadership at small and mid-sized firms. I am super excited to have Darren Farry as a guest to share his journey with us. Darren has 25 years of rich experience in finance leadership across companies of various shapes and sizes. He currently serves as the CEO of Thoughtful CFO and has been the CFO at Electric Puppets. Darren has also worked in finance leadership roles at firms like Unitron Global and Descartes Systems Group.
On a personal note, I’ve had some great discussions with Darren about our go-to-market strategy for FinFlow’s product and his journey. He’s shared some incredible insights about our use cases for credit risk coding and accounts receivable, particularly how our product links with billing and CRM systems like Salesforce and impacts sales teams. Those discussions were inspiring and insightful. So, welcome, Darren, to our podcast! I hope you’re doing great.
Darren Farry: It’s great to be here, Amartya. I really appreciate the opportunity.
Amartya Singh: Thanks, Darren. Let’s kickstart the podcast. First up, I’d love to hear about your finance leadership journey—your experiences working with startups, enterprises, and firms of different sizes, culminating, of course, in your fractional CFO role. How has the journey been over the last 25 years? I’m sure it’s been both challenging and rewarding, with different companies, people, and challenges along the way. We’d love to hear your story.
Darren Farry: It’s hard to believe it’s been 25 years, but yes, that’s about right! I graduated from Wilfrid Laurier University here in Waterloo with a Bachelor of Business Administration. Initially, I didn’t plan to go into finance, but my first job out of school was in a finance department. I had a couple of mentors there—both accountants—who encouraged me to pursue a designation if I wanted to grow in finance.
At the time, there were three different accounting designations in Canada. I opted for the Certified Management Accountant (CMA) designation, which I’m glad I did. It went beyond just finance and accounting, covering topics like marketing, operations, logistics, and HR. This broader perspective has served me well throughout my career.
Before I completed my designation, I worked as an ERP consultant during the Y2K period, helping implement financial systems. That was a fascinating time, as everyone was focused on ensuring systems didn’t fail. It taught me a lot about system implementation and processes—skills I still use today.
Later, I spent 20 years at Unitron, a division of Sonova, the world’s leading hearing healthcare company. I climbed the ranks there, starting as a financial analyst. Early in my tenure, two senior finance leaders left within weeks of each other. That opened the door for me to step into their roles on an interim basis. I must have done well because the CEO asked me to stay on permanently.
For 10 years, I led finance for Unitron’s Global Headquarters and its Wholesale Division in Canada. After that, I briefly transitioned to sales before becoming Managing Director of Unitron Canada, overseeing marketing, tech support, customer service, and operations. This variety gave me exposure to areas beyond finance, which I thoroughly enjoyed.
Eventually, I launched my own fractional CFO firm, Thoughtful CFO, to help small and medium-sized businesses. It allows me to bring not only financial expertise but also insights into other business areas. It’s been a rewarding journey so far.
Amartya Singh: Got it. One thing that stands out is your extensive experience in the Canadian ecosystem. Canada’s startup and corporate culture is known for being supportive and innovative. Do you primarily work with Canadian firms, or is your scope more global?
Darren Farry: My focus is primarily on Canadian organizations, but I’ve also worked with a few U.S.-based clients. Honestly, I’m open to helping companies wherever they are. I love the variety of industries and challenges I’ve been able to work on, and I’m excited to expand my scope further as opportunities arise.
Amartya Singh: That’s great to hear. You mentioned the Y2K period earlier, which must have been a pivotal moment in your career. We’ll touch on finance technologies later, but I’m curious about your mentors and how their guidance influenced your decision to leap into finance. It’s fascinating how those early decisions shaped your trajectory.
Also, as a fractional CFO, how do you typically work with your clients? How do you help them with growth, bookkeeping, accounting, and other aspects of their journey?
Darren Farry: Great question. One of the things I’ve learned is that small and medium-sized businesses often see finance as purely compliance-focused—record-keeping and historical reporting. What I bring to the table is “future-looking” finance—helping businesses predict and plan for the future.
My first step with any client is stabilizing their financial systems. Often, there’s chaos in their records or processes that needs sorting out. Once things are organized, I move on to benchmarking and implementing metrics to track performance. This gives them a clear picture of their current situation and helps us plan for the future.
For example, I focus heavily on cash flow projections, budgeting, and planning. Many businesses underestimate the value of budgeting, but it’s empowering. A good budget lets you confidently invest in initiatives without worrying about cash flow surprises. It’s about giving founders and CEOs the reassurance they need to make informed decisions and sleep better at night.
On a monthly basis, I sit down with clients to review their financials, track progress, and adjust forecasts as needed. It’s incredibly rewarding to see the difference this visibility makes for them.
Amartya Singh: That’s insightful. You touched on the importance of learning earlier. How do you think finance professionals can stay updated in a rapidly evolving world? And how can they balance the day-to-day chaos with strategic thinking?
Darren Farry: Learning is crucial, but it often gets deprioritized because of how busy people are. Leaders need to create an environment where learning is encouraged and prioritized. It’s not just an “extra” task—it’s an investment in the future.
As an individual, you also need to carve out time for learning. Even setting aside an hour or two each week to watch videos, read articles, or explore new tools can make a big difference. The key is to focus on learning that directly improves your processes or adds value to your role.
In terms of balancing chaos with strategic thinking, it’s about creating systems that streamline routine tasks. When you reduce the time spent on operational firefighting, you free up bandwidth for forward-looking planning. That’s where tools and technology can play a huge role.
Amartya Singh: That’s a great perspective. Darren, let’s talk about Thoughtful CFO. What was your vision when you started, and how has it evolved so far?
Darren Farry: The name “Thoughtful CFO” was my wife’s idea, and it’s a perfect fit. It reflects both innovation and empathy. On one hand, “thoughtful” means creative problem-solving and innovative ideas. On the other hand, it emphasizes caring and understanding.
My vision is to bring both of these elements to my clients. I want to help them implement systems and strategies that improve their businesses while also fostering a positive culture. People spend a significant portion of their lives working, so it’s important to create environments they enjoy being part of.
At its core, Thoughtful CFO is about making finance accessible and empowering for small and medium-sized businesses. I strive to leave clients better equipped to manage their finances confidently and effectively.
Amartya Singh: Got it. Thanks, Darren. You’ve worked with firms of all shapes and sizes, from global organizations to startups. Could you share some of the most interesting and challenging experiences you’ve had in your career so far? What were the key takeaways from those moments?
Darren Farry: Sure, Amartya. One of the most memorable experiences was during my time at Unitron. As I mentioned earlier, I stepped into a leadership role quite suddenly after two senior finance leaders left within weeks of each other. It was a trial by fire, but it taught me the importance of adaptability and being prepared to seize opportunities when they arise. That role significantly shaped my leadership style and confidence.
Another challenging yet rewarding experience was transitioning from finance to sales leadership. Managing the entire Canadian division of Unitron exposed me to marketing, tech support, and operations. The steep learning curve was intimidating, but it underscored the value of collaboration and leveraging the strengths of your team. That experience broadened my perspective and helped me become a more well-rounded leader.
Amartya Singh: Those are amazing stories, Darren. It’s clear that stepping out of your comfort zone has been a key factor in your growth. What advice would you give to finance professionals looking to advance their careers?
Darren Farry: My advice would be to embrace learning and seek out challenges that push you beyond your current capabilities. Growth doesn't happen within the confines of comfort. Look for opportunities to work on projects or roles that stretch your skills, even if they’re outside your immediate area of expertise. These experiences build adaptability, confidence, and a broader perspective.
Another key piece of advice is to focus on building relationships. Networking within and outside your organization can open doors to mentorship, collaborations, and learning opportunities. Strong relationships are invaluable for both personal and professional growth.
Lastly, develop a strategic mindset. Don’t just focus on numbers—understand the bigger picture of how finance connects to other business areas like operations, marketing, and sales. The more you align finance with the company’s overall strategy, the more valuable you’ll become as a leader.
Amartya Singh: That’s fantastic advice. It’s clear that your journey has been fueled by a combination of learning, adaptability, and collaboration. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to share about your vision for the future or the evolving role of CFOs?
Darren Farry: Absolutely, Amartya. The role of the CFO is becoming increasingly dynamic. It’s no longer just about managing numbers; it’s about being a strategic partner to the business, driving growth, and enabling innovation. As technology continues to evolve, CFOs will need to harness data analytics, AI, and other tools to make more informed and forward-looking decisions.
For Thoughtful CFO, my vision is to continue helping businesses navigate this shift. I want to empower more small and medium-sized companies to view finance as a strategic asset rather than just a compliance function. By simplifying financial processes and fostering a culture of learning, I hope to enable these businesses to thrive in today’s complex and competitive environment.
Amartya Singh: That’s an inspiring vision, Darren. Thank you so much for sharing your journey and insights with us today. It’s been a pleasure having you on the podcast.
Darren Farry: Thank you, Amartya. It’s been a wonderful conversation, and I appreciate the opportunity to share my thoughts. Wishing you and FinFlow continued success!
Amartya Singh: Thank you, Darren. And to our listeners, thank you for tuning in to the fifth episode of Inside the CFO Office. Stay tuned for more inspiring conversations with finance leaders. Until next time, take care and stay curious. Goodbye!
Thanks, everyone, for joining the fourth episode of the Inside the CFO Office podcast. We look forward to seeing you in the fifth episode. Have a great day!

      transcript: `Amartya Singh: Hello everyone! I'm your host, Amartya Singh, co-founder and CEO of FinFloh, a product built by and for modern finance teams. We are back with the fourth episode of our podcast series, Inside the CFO Office, an exclusive channel for finance professionals to learn more about the journeys of finance leaders and trailblazers in the CFO office.
Today, we are super excited to have Ruchi Kasliwal as a guest to share her journey and experience in bridging the gaps between finance, revenue, and operations. Ruchi brings over 20 years of stellar experience, with a proven history of expertise in finance operations, strategy, and assembling and empowering teams to navigate rapid growth within SaaS, subscription, and enterprise software sectors.
Currently, Ruchi serves as an advisor and leads firms at Clarity and DoubleFin. Prior to this, she held finance leadership roles at Singularity University, Telenav, Confluent, MongoDB, and Kosher Technology, where she spearheaded finance and operations functions, led M&A activities, and drove strategic growth initiatives. With a robust track record in high-growth tech companies, Ruchi has consistently contributed to financial success and operational efficiencies.
I have loved Ruchi's product-focused approach during our past discussions. I remember a conversation we had on the importance of credit scoring and credit decisioning—something we’ve built into our product. We discussed its impact on firms, the sales and finance functions, and onboarding processes. We even incorporated some of her feedback into our product. So, here we are, looking forward to an engaging conversation today.
Welcome to the podcast, Ruchi!
Ruchi Kasliwal: Thank you, Amartya. It’s a pleasure to be here. I’m excited for our discussion.
Amartya Singh: Great! Let’s dive right in. You’ve worked across various companies of different shapes and sizes, particularly in the tech sector. You must have seen many challenges and growth stories. How has your journey been so far, leading up to your current finance leadership roles?
Ruchi Kasliwal: My career journey spans from very small companies to high-growth startups and even late-stage startups that I’ve taken public. It’s been a rollercoaster ride. Each company comes with its own unique challenges and rewards. In smaller companies, it’s all hands on deck. You’re not just the finance person; you’re handling a bit of everything. In larger organizations, responsibilities are more defined and focused.
As the stage of the company changes, your roles and responsibilities evolve. That’s the beauty of being in a startup environment—you learn so much in a short span of time.
Amartya Singh: Right. You’ve worked at startups and larger organizations. When you’re at a startup, you take on diverse roles, and the learning is immense. As you moved through different organizations, like MongoDB, Telenav, and Singularity University, how did you adapt to the varying requirements of these roles and industries?
Ruchi Kasliwal: Each company is unique, even within the same sector. Their products, processes, and focus areas differ. For example, at MongoDB, my initial focus was on building the revenue team—learning the product, understanding revenue recognition for that product, and developing backend processes to help the organization scale. At Telenav, revenue operations were also a key focus—understanding the sales channels, deal structures, and ensuring the infrastructure supported growth.
At Singularity University, my role expanded significantly. I wasn’t just handling accounting and finance but also led the IT and RevOps organizations. This required thinking beyond finance—figuring out solutions, tools, and systems for the entire organization, including engineering and IT operations. It’s been a continuous learning process, and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed the journey.
Amartya Singh: Got it. With each role, you must have faced challenges—whether with people, processes, or systems. What were the top two business challenges you encountered, and how did you navigate them?
Ruchi Kasliwal: Narrowing it down, I’d say learning to work with product and sales teams was a significant challenge. As a finance leader, your role touches every part of the organization—product, sales, operations, HR, and more. Understanding the product—how it’s built and what it aims to achieve—was crucial. Similarly, understanding how sales functions, how they position the product in the market, and how finance can support their success was another key challenge.
For instance, simplifying processes for sales teams can make a big difference. Take a travel and expense (T&E) process as an example—if it’s overly complex, it becomes a pain point for salespeople, who are often on the go. Keeping processes simple supports growth and ensures smooth collaboration.
Amartya Singh: That’s insightful. Moving to another question—you’ve worked across startups, mid-sized companies, and enterprises. Each comes with unique challenges—different cash flows, decision-making processes, onboarding, and more. What has been your approach to navigating these differences?
Ruchi Kasliwal: My core approach has always been to keep it simple. Overcomplicating things doesn’t help. For example, sales processes at MongoDB, Telenav, and Singularity were vastly different. At MongoDB, I launched the deal desk function, which streamlined sales cycles and helped the company scale. At Telenav, the sales cycle was longer but simpler, with fewer variables. At Singularity, sales were relationship-driven rather than product-driven.
Adapting to these differences required understanding the complexities of each organization and tailoring processes and tools to meet their specific needs. Building strong relationships with the product and sales teams was key to aligning processes with organizational goals.
Amartya Singh: When implementing tools at these companies, how did you handle the learning curve? Who did you collaborate with, and how long did it typically take to deliver results?
Ruchi Kasliwal: Learning is constant, no matter how experienced you are. My first step is always to understand the company, its products, and its goals. I work closely with the CPO or head of product to understand their roadmap and with the CRO to align on go-to-market strategies. Designing territories and quotas, for example, involves both top-down and bottom-up approaches—it’s a collaborative effort with FP&A, sales ops, and finance teams.
Building strong relationships with the CRO and sales ops teams is critical. Syncing metrics between finance and sales ensures alignment and prevents discrepancies during leadership presentations. This collaboration lays the foundation for effective execution.
Amartya Singh: We touched on RevOps earlier, and I’d love to dive deeper. How does RevOps impact finance operations, and how do people, processes, and systems play a role?
Ruchi Kasliwal: RevOps is integral to organizational growth. Previously termed sales ops, RevOps now encompasses marketing, GTM, and finance functions. From people to processes and technology, RevOps holds the company’s growth together.
For example, defining MQL-to-SQL transitions, deal structures, and standard vs. non-standard terms requires RevOps’ involvement. On the finance side, RevOps plays a role in commission calculations, pipeline management, and CRM-to-ERP integrations. Streamlined processes and effective tools ensure data flows seamlessly, enabling accurate reporting and decision-making.
Amartya Singh: Speaking of tools, integrating CRMs like Salesforce with ERPs like NetSuite often poses challenges. What’s been your experience in overcoming these gaps?
Ruchi Kasliwal: Integration challenges are common. At Confluent, for instance, orders were manually keyed into NetSuite from Salesforce. We implemented an API connection, automating the process and saving significant time during monthly close cycles.
Technology should be your ally, not a foe. Leveraging it effectively improves efficiency and reduces human error. For smaller organizations without internal expertise, partnering with third-party integrators can help manage such transitions effectively.
Amartya Singh: Let’s talk about finance software stacks and AI. What has been your experience with finance tools, and how do you see AI shaping the future?
Ruchi Kasliwal: I’m passionate about AI—it’s a game changer across industries. While some fear job displacement, I see it as an opportunity to enhance productivity and focus on strategic tasks. For instance, billing analysts can automate repetitive tasks using AI and redirect their time toward value-added activities.
When implementing finance tools, planning is critical. Understand your organization’s current and future needs, assess data readiness, and plan for smooth transitions. A poorly planned ERP migration, for example, can lead to inefficiencies and missed opportunities. With AI, tools will only become smarter, offering predictive insights and streamlining operations further.
Amartya Singh: This has been an incredibly insightful conversation, Ruchi. Before we wrap up, what advice would you give to aspiring finance leaders?
Ruchi Kasliwal: My advice would be to embrace lifelong learning. The finance world is evolving rapidly, and staying updated is crucial. Listen carefully to different perspectives, understand the challenges, and then execute your plans. Building strong relationships across the organization is key—whether it’s with product teams, sales teams, or leadership. Collaboration ensures alignment and drives better outcomes.
Another piece of advice is to focus on data-driven decision-making. In today’s world, numbers tell a story. Whether you’re implementing a new tool, revising processes, or planning strategies, always use data to support your arguments and decisions. Data provides clarity, removes bias, and helps you build a strong case for your initiatives. It also enables you to measure the impact of your actions and adjust your approach when needed.
Finally, don’t forget to consider the human element. While data is critical, understanding the people behind the processes is equally important. Empathy and clear communication go a long way in addressing concerns, resolving pushbacks, and fostering collaboration across teams. Combining data-driven insights with a people-centric approach creates a balanced strategy that benefits both your team and the organization as a whole.
Amartya Singh: Got it.
Ruchi Kasliwal: Those are just a few of my learnings and reflections from my journey. Over time, I’ve really grown by embracing these principles.
Amartya Singh: Right, right. Got it. Thanks, Ruchi. It was great having you on the podcast. We had such an insightful conversation covering multiple aspects of RevOps, finance technologies, and the importance of planning for finance team members.
Thanks, everyone, for joining the fourth episode of the Inside the CFO Office podcast. We look forward to seeing you in the fifth episode. Have a great day!

We are back with the third episode of our podcast series, Inside the CFO Office, an exclusive channel for finance professionals to explore the journeys of finance leaders and trailblazers in the CFO office, delve into the challenges they’ve faced, and hear their perspectives on the future of finance.
In today’s episode, we are super excited to have Josh Troy as our guest to share his journey and his experience in building and scaling finance functions at high-growth software companies. Josh brings over 15 years of experience leading business and finance teams in diverse industries, including real estate, advertising, AI, and health tech. He has played pivotal roles in multiple growth stories and acquisitions. Currently, Josh serves as the CFO at PatchRx, a leading medication adherence platform. Prior to this, he co-founded Urbint, focusing on leveraging real-world data and AI to prevent critical incidents. Earlier, he held finance leadership roles at Spotad, CompStak, and StreetEasy, where he led the company’s $50M acquisition.
Josh, I’ve had some fascinating conversations with you about the evolution of finance leadership and technology at high-growth software companies. Your insights have been a revelation, and I’m thrilled to have you share your journey with our listeners. Welcome to the podcast, Josh!
Josh Troy: Thank you, Amartya. I appreciate the opportunity and am excited to be here.
Amartya Singh: Let’s dive right in. You’ve had such an exciting career across various industries and finance functions. That must have required a unique ability to adapt and context-switch between different tools and industries. Can you share more about your journey leading finance teams in industries ranging from real estate to advertising, all the way to AI and health tech?
Josh Troy: Absolutely, Amartya. My journey has been shaped by a strong foundational interest in business operations, models, and strategy. I’ve always been curious about what makes a business successful—how it markets itself, its positioning, and overall strategy. For me, accounting was the scorecard that tied everything together, which led me to study accounting in undergrad and earn my CPA in New York.
I started my career at KPMG, working in advisory and consulting. This gave me exposure to internal and external audit processes, which helped me understand financial operations and accurate reporting. While at KPMG, I worked with companies across different industries in the U.S. and Europe. However, I always knew I wanted to move to the operational side of businesses.
In 2013, I joined StreetEasy as their first finance hire. At the time, they were a post-Series A company with around 35 employees. They were looking to expand into new markets and mature their finance function. Within a few weeks of joining, the company received a term sheet from Zillow, leading to a $50M acquisition. That quick pivot taught me how rapidly things can change in the startup world and the importance of staying agile.
After StreetEasy, I held finance leadership roles at several companies, including CompStak, a commercial real estate data exchange platform, and Spotad, a mobile ad tech company leveraging AI for real-time bidding. Each role added a unique layer of experience, from managing venture debt to scaling international operations. Eventually, I co-founded Urbint, where we used AI to predict and prevent incidents for utilities and workers. Today, at PatchRx, I’m focused on scaling operations and driving financial strategy in the health tech space.
Amartya Singh: That’s an incredible journey, Josh. It’s fascinating how you’ve navigated such diverse industries. One common thread seems to be your ability to adapt and lead through change. Could you share some insights on how you’ve managed transitions, especially during critical moments like acquisitions or rapid scaling?
Josh Troy: Transitions are challenging, but they’re also exciting opportunities to learn and grow. During acquisitions, the finance team plays a strategic role in maximizing value. For example, when we sold StreetEasy to Zillow, I partnered closely with the CEO to create demand and negotiate the best deal. It required a balance of strategy and execution, from preparing the data room to aligning on the vision with potential buyers.
Navigating rapid scaling is equally complex. At Urbint, we started pre-revenue and grew into a leading AI company for utility safety. Scaling required constant focus on building the right team, aligning priorities, and adapting to market dynamics. The COVID-19 pandemic was a major challenge—it disrupted our fundraising plans, but we persevered by being transparent with the team, staying optimistic, and leveraging strategic opportunities.
Amartya Singh: Your ability to balance strategy with execution is impressive. Speaking of strategy, let’s talk about finance technology. You’ve seen the evolution of finance tech firsthand. How do you view the current landscape, and where do you think it’s heading?
Josh Troy: The finance tech landscape has evolved rapidly. Ten years ago, finance teams relied heavily on manual processes. Today, automation and AI have transformed how we work. Tools like NetSuite, Dynamics, and SAP S/4HANA are now integrating with modern solutions like Airbase, Ramp, and Brex to streamline workflows.
AI is playing an increasingly important role in automating back-office tasks like accounts payable and receivable. For example, machine learning can predict transaction categories and flag anomalies, significantly reducing manual intervention. Large language models like ChatGPT are also making an impact, offering quick answers to technical accounting questions and aiding in scenario analysis. The challenge for finance leaders is keeping up with the pace of innovation while ensuring new tools align with business goals.
Amartya Singh: That’s a great perspective. With AI and automation enabling leaner finance teams, what do you see as the future role of finance professionals?
Josh Troy: As routine tasks become automated, finance professionals will focus more on strategic initiatives. This includes scenario planning, investor relations, and partnering with other departments to drive business growth. The role will shift from being transactional to analytical, requiring a deep understanding of data and how to use it effectively.
Amartya Singh: Fascinating. Let’s wrap up with a personal question. For aspiring finance professionals, what are the top two pieces of advice you’d offer to help them grow into leadership roles?
Josh Troy: First, build strong relationships. Whether it’s networking with mentors or collaborating with colleagues, relationships are critical for career growth. Many challenges have already been solved by others, and leveraging those insights can save time and effort.
Second, focus on accuracy and diligence. As a finance leader, your credibility hinges on the reliability of the data you present. Always double-check your work and ensure it’s accurate. Taking pride in your work builds trust and sets the foundation for long-term success.
Amartya Singh: That’s excellent advice, Josh. Thank you so much for sharing your journey and insights. It’s been a pleasure having you on the podcast.
Josh Troy: Thank you, Amartya. I’ve enjoyed our conversation and appreciate the opportunity to share my story.
Amartya Singh: And with that, we conclude our third episode of Inside the CFO Office. Stay tuned for more inspiring conversations with finance leaders. Until next time!`,

  Amartya Singh: Hello, everyone! I'm your host, Amartya Singh, co-founder and CEO of FinFloh—a product built by and for modern finance teams. We are back with the second episode of our podcast series, Inside the CFO Office, an exclusive channel for finance professionals to explore the journeys of finance leaders and trailblazers in the CFO office, delve into the biggest challenges they've faced and solved, and hear their perspectives on the future of finance.
  In today's episode, we are thrilled to have Dustin Walsted as our guest to discuss the topic of "Navigating the Finance, Sales, and Strategy Conundrum." Dustin has over 15 years of diverse experience spanning industries such as education, banking, railroads, real estate, and marketing services. He currently serves as the VP of Finance, Technology, Strategy, and HR at Smart City Apartment Locating and Smart City Digital. Dustin holds an MBA from the Naveen Jindal School of Management, UT Dallas, and a Bachelor of Science degree from Texas Christian University.
  What stands out most about Dustin is his incredible ability to grasp the significance and applicability of technology and strategy in finance and beyond. Welcome, Dustin! It’s an honor to have you here on the podcast.
  Dustin Walsted: Thank you, Amartya. I appreciate the opportunity.
  Amartya Singh: Let’s kick off the discussion. Your career journey is fascinating. You've worked across sectors from education to railroads to the steel industry, and you've handled various roles, from student affairs to finance leadership. While that must have been exciting, I imagine it also came with its fair share of challenges. Could you tell us more about your journey and how you navigated the transitions to where you are today as a finance leader?
  Dustin Walsted: Ironically, I never thought I’d end up as a finance leader. I’ve even joked that I failed undergraduate accounting, and yet here I am leading finance teams. Looking back, I can see how each role I’ve held taught me valuable lessons that shaped the leader I am today.
  After high school, I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do, so I pursued an associate’s degree at a community college. Joining Phi Theta Kappa, the international honor society for two-year colleges, was transformative. As a chapter officer and president, I developed leadership skills and learned to rally people around shared goals. Whether organizing street cleanups or managing campaigns, I gained firsthand experience in collaboration and problem-solving.
  Later, I took on roles teaching high school students and mediating disputes between college students. If you’ve ever had to teach or mediate for students, you’ll know it humbles and sharpens your ability to break down concepts and foster understanding—skills I still use when working with cross-departmental teams.
  When I transitioned into the railroad industry, I was in a cross-departmental operational role, working on safety systems. While pursuing my MBA, I noticed a finance role that aligned with my project management experience. I prepared rigorously, interviewed, and—despite bombing the Excel model in the first round—impressed them with the questions I asked. They saw potential in my cross-functional experience and willingness to learn, which became a theme throughout my finance career.
  Over time, I moved from operationally focused roles to strategic finance positions, eventually overseeing billions of dollars in projects. At my current organization, I’ve helped scale the business fourfold, thanks to a mix of technology, strategy, and a curious mindset.
  Amartya Singh: That’s an incredible story. It’s inspiring to see how you turned setbacks into opportunities and how your curiosity has fueled your growth. One point you mentioned—about learning across functions—really resonates with me. Having worked across sectors, what drove you to venture beyond the limits of finance into areas like sales, strategy, and technology?
  Dustin Walsted: Two key reasons: the needs of the business and my own nature. Working in lean or startup environments forces you to be a generalist. You have to understand multiple functions because priorities change rapidly, and there isn’t a deep hierarchy to cascade decisions. This gave me a natural platform to explore how different parts of the business interact.
  On a personal level, I get bored quickly. I’m not someone who thrives on routine, so diving into different areas keeps me engaged. At the same time, I’ve learned the importance of building complementary teams. My strengths lie in deep dives and big-picture thinking, but I’m not always the most consistent with follow-through. That’s where my team shines. We’ve built a culture where strengths are recognized, weaknesses are addressed, and collaboration is key.
  Another factor is my natural curiosity. I’m always asking, “How can we improve this?” For example, I recently worked with our customer experience team to map their workflows and identify efficiencies. By tying their metrics to financial outcomes, we found areas to improve execution—a win-win for everyone.
  Amartya Singh: I love that—a curiosity-driven approach and the ability to connect dots across functions. You’ve also emphasized the importance of complementary skill sets within a team. How does working across finance and non-finance teams differ, and what challenges have you encountered?
  Dustin Walsted: The biggest commonality is that everyone wants to do good work—they just define success differently. Finance focuses on margins and returns; marketing wants reach and engagement; ops cares about execution and uptime. The challenge lies in aligning those goals to a common strategy and keeping communication open. I've had to learn how to tailor messaging, simplify metrics, and make data more relatable across functions. Building trust has been key.
  Amartya Singh: That’s a fantastic insight. As we start to wrap up, what advice would you give to aspiring finance leaders trying to navigate their own journeys?
  Dustin Walsted: Two things: First, don’t underestimate the value of storytelling in finance. Data is powerful, but how you communicate it determines your impact. Learn to tell stories with numbers—it’s what influences decisions. Second, never stop learning. The tools, the roles, the expectations—they’ll keep evolving. Stay curious, stay adaptable, and keep stretching beyond your comfort zone.
  Amartya Singh: Beautifully said, Dustin. Thank you for sharing your insights and your journey with us today. It’s been a pleasure.
  Dustin Walsted: Likewise, thank you for having me.

Amartya Singh: Hello, everyone! I'm your host, Amartya Singh, co-founder and CEO of FinFloh—a product built by and for modern finance teams. We're thrilled to welcome you to the season opener of our podcast, Inside the CFO Office. This is an exclusive channel for finance professionals to explore the journeys of finance leaders, hear their solutions to major challenges, and get their perspectives on the future of finance.
In today's episode, we’re delighted to have Rachel Camarillo as our very first guest. Rachel heads finance and accounting at Filson. With over 25 years of experience managing and leading finance and accounting teams across industries like retail, hospitality, and manufacturing, Rachel brings unparalleled expertise to the table. She was honored as one of Puget Sound’s 40 Under 40 in 2021 and is the founder of the Women in Manufacturing Washington chapter, empowering women in the industry. Most importantly, Rachel is someone I deeply admire and whose insights and advice I’ve greatly valued. Many fondly call her “sunshine in human form,” and I couldn’t agree more.
Rachel Camarillo: Thank you for having me, Amartya.
Amartya Singh: It’s fantastic to have you here, Rachel. I’m sure our listeners are eager to learn more about your incredible journey and your take on the current and future landscape of finance. To start, I’d love for you to share your personal journey. You began as an accounting assistant and have risen to lead finance and accounting at some of the most prestigious firms. What were the biggest challenges and lessons along the way?
Rachel Camarillo: Thank you, Amartya. My journey wasn’t the traditional path. Many of my peers from college went directly into auditing with big accounting firms, but I took a different route. My brain didn’t quite resonate with tax legislation and regulation—although I could manage it, I found it daunting. So, I chose to work in operations, where I fell in love with the business side of finance.
I started working young. My first “job” was with my mom and aunts, making and selling kitchen potholders and washcloth sets. We handled everything from painting designs to sewing and selling the products. It taught me the full process of running a business, even if I didn’t fully appreciate it back then.
Through high school, I worked retail jobs to support my family and save for college. I learned to open and close tills, perform pricing audits, and manage merchandising—skills I draw upon even now in my current role. In college, I juggled food service jobs and random accounting roles to make ends meet. Right after graduation, I started at Red Lion Hotels in Spokane, where I gained invaluable experience.
While my friends were auditing, I was on the other side, running audits, implementing ERP systems, and handling SEC and board reporting. Red Lion exposed me to the entire finance spectrum, from daily hotel operations to consolidation reporting. Those nine years were formative—I had amazing mentors and said “yes” to every opportunity, even when I didn’t know what I was getting into.
Amartya Singh: That’s incredible. The way you embraced opportunities, even without knowing the outcomes, clearly shaped your career.
Rachel Camarillo: Absolutely. During my time at Red Lion, I also pursued a parallel career in the restaurant industry. I helped open and manage restaurants, which was exhilarating and provided hands-on experience with leadership, employee training, and real-time problem-solving. Balancing corporate finance during the day and running restaurants at night gave me unique insights into business operations.
Eventually, I moved to Seattle to be closer to family and entered the manufacturing industry, which was a completely new challenge. I learned the terminology, processes, and complexities of scaling a company from $5 million to $40 million. That’s when I truly fell in love with manufacturing and founded the Women in Manufacturing Washington chapter to build a supportive community.
Amartya Singh: Wow, what an inspiring journey! Your ability to adapt across industries is remarkable. Speaking of challenges, let’s shift gears. Post-2020, cash flow management has become critical for businesses. Outdated practices and manual processes often hinder efficiency. What changes have you observed in cash flow management since 2020, and how have you navigated these challenges?
Rachel Camarillo: Cash flow management today requires long-term planning. During the pandemic, I faced scenarios where income streams disappeared overnight. For example, I joined an aviation company just a week before the city lockdowns. With no one traveling, revenue dropped to zero for months. We had to adapt quickly, running stress tests, renegotiating contracts, and educating teams about the financial impact of every decision.
Transparency was key. We involved every team member, from aircraft detailers to maintenance staff, helping them understand how their roles contributed to profitability. It was a powerful moment—everyone aligned around the “respect for the dollar” and worked toward collective financial resilience.
Amartya Singh: I love that phrase, “respect for the dollar.” It highlights the importance of collective responsibility for cash flow across an organization. Your emphasis on transparency and team involvement is a game-changer.
Rachel Camarillo: Exactly. When everyone understands the impact of their actions on the bottom line, it fosters accountability and smarter decision-making.
Amartya Singh: Let’s dive deeper into scaling businesses. As companies grow from $10 million to $100 million and beyond, the finance technology landscape evolves significantly. Can you share your insights on how finance technology has changed and your experience with ERP transformation projects?
Rachel Camarillo: Finance technology has advanced tremendously. Companies still using systems from the early 2000s are at a disadvantage. Modern tools not only collect data but also provide actionable insights. ERP transformations are particularly challenging but necessary for scalability. My approach has always been to minimize customizations. Instead of forcing a new system to replicate old processes, I focus on understanding the core capabilities of the system and aligning processes to leverage those features.
Mapping workflows is essential. It helps identify redundancies and ensures seamless integration. For example, open APIs are game-changers—they enable scalability and reduce manual intervention by automating backend processes. Transformation projects are painful, but they’re worth it when done strategically.
Amartya Singh: Great points. Legacy systems and excessive customizations often create more problems than they solve. Your roadmap-focused approach simplifies scaling while keeping the big picture in mind. One last question before we wrap up: What advice would you give to aspiring finance professionals aiming for leadership roles?
Rachel Camarillo: First, don’t underestimate the potential of a finance career. It’s far from boring and offers immense opportunities to drive value and strategy within an organization. Second, be curious. Never stop asking questions or seeking to understand how things work. Curiosity not only expands your knowledge but also builds connections and fosters collaboration.
Finally, embrace opportunities early in your career. Saying “yes” to challenges helps you discover what fuels you. Over time, this clarity allows you to focus on what truly matters and deliver greater impact.
Amartya Singh: That’s fantastic advice. Curiosity and adaptability are indeed key to growth. Rachel, it’s been an absolute pleasure speaking with you. Your journey and insights are inspiring, and I’m sure our listeners will take away valuable lessons. Thank you for being part of our season opener.
Rachel Camarillo: Thank you, Amartya. Best of luck with FinFloh. I’m excited to see how it continues to grow and make a difference.
Amartya Singh: Thanks, Rachel. And with that, we conclude our first episode of Inside the CFO Office. Stay tuned for more engaging discussions with finance leaders. Until next time! Bye.`,

      Subhasis (Intro): Welcome to Episode X of Finance Leaders in Focus. Today I’m joined by Jernita Prince, Sr. Director of Billing & Accounts Receivable at Trace3. Jernita brings nearly 25 years of experience in billing and accounts receivable, and she’s been at the forefront of automation-led finance transformation.
      Jernita: I wouldn’t even call this a journey—it’s been an odyssey of 25 years in accounts receivable.
      Subhasis: Your experience across startups and large enterprises gives you a unique lens on how finance evolves at scale.
      Jernita: Growth for me has been about moving from transactional work to driving real business outcomes.
      Subhasis: You’ve seen finance shift from being viewed as a cost to delivering measurable ROI through technology.
      Jernita: The biggest challenge in transformation isn’t systems—it’s mindset, starting with leadership. Leaders have to think three to five years ahead and clearly articulate the path forward.
      Subhasis: When finance leaders embrace innovation, teams unlock far more value from technology.
      Jernita: Successful automation starts by defining what “good looks like,” not by fixing things as you go. If you automate flawed processes, you just make bad outcomes happen faster. Clean data and strong parent processes are what make automation actually work. Automation should support long-term vision—not just solve short-term problems.
      Subhasis: Let’s talk about invoicing and collections.
      Jernita: Clean invoices are the foundation for effective collections—everything depends on that. Invoice accuracy directly impacts customer experience, not just internal efficiency. Poor cash application creates friction for customers, not just accounting issues.
      Subhasis: Automated dunning alone isn’t enough.
      Jernita: Exactly. You need intelligence to focus on the right customers. AR becomes strategic when you understand customer payment behavior—not just DSO. Knowing why a customer didn’t pay is more valuable than simply getting a promise to pay. AR teams are the conduit between execution and real business insight.
      Subhasis (Closing): This shift—from transactional execution to insight-driven finance—is exactly how technology, data, and leadership together reshape the office of the CFO.

      Subhasis: Welcome to Episode 6 of Finance Leaders in Focus. I’m joined by Amit Raj Chandla, Director of Accounts Receivable at Clean Harbors. With 20 years across OTC, P2P, and R2R, he’s scaled finance ops and unlocked millions in working capital.
      Amit: Thanks, Subhasis. Great to be here.
      Subhasis: Let’s start with your journey. What drew you into finance?
      Amit: I began in collections, moved to order management, then led end-to-end A/R, and even got into P2P and R2R. Each role gave me a broader view—from collecting to spending and reporting. That 360° view helped me solve bigger business problems.
      Subhasis: That’s rare. Most leaders stick to one function. How did that help you?
      Amit: It shifted my mindset. I no longer saw siloed tasks—I looked for full-cycle solutions. It taught me to improve cash flow by connecting customer and vendor behaviors.
      Subhasis: Let’s talk about leading finance teams. What’s your leadership approach?
      Amit: I follow three principles:
      Accountability with empowerment—Give people decision-making power with support.


      Empathetic communication—Understand the pressures stakeholders face.


      Adaptability—Finance must evolve with tech. Sticking to legacy ways limits growth.


      Subhasis: You’ve led impactful projects—can you share a couple?
      Amit: Sure. First was building a predictive analytics model for collections. It flagged likely disputes, forecasted payments, and helped collectors prioritize better. Second was digitizing customer master data—onboarding went from days to just 4 minutes via a mobile app integrated with ERP.
      Subhasis: Amazing. Let’s shift to technology. How do you decide whether a process needs automation?
      Amit: I look at 3 things:
      Process maturity – Is it stable or chaotic?


      Data quality & tools – Legacy ERPs can limit automation.


      Team capabilities – Are people trained to use new tools?


      If any of these are weak, I fix the fundamentals first—via process excellence—before jumping into automation.
      Subhasis: And if your ERP is old?
      Amit: Then we evaluate: Do we build on top, buy a third-party solution like HighRadius or Celonis, or upgrade entirely? It’s a cost, capability, and value decision.
      Subhasis: Is AI really becoming part of the CFO tech stack?
      Amit: Absolutely. Finance is moving from spreadsheets to real-time, insight-led decisions. AI helps with cashflow predictions, dispute resolutions, embedded dashboards—even answering strategic questions like “Why is DSO rising?” without relying on an analyst.
      Subhasis: Final thoughts?
      Amit: AI isn’t replacing us. It’s augmenting us. Finance leaders who embrace it—and build teams that understand tech—will lead the next wave of transformation.

      transcript: `Subhasis Sahoo: Welcome to the fifth episode of AI in Finance. Today, we’re diving into how smarter finance teams can be built with a strong foundation in data, governance, and AI. I’m thrilled to be joined by Abhishek Chandna, Director of Finance Strategy and Governance at Visa, whose career spans transformative roles at Autodesk and Visa, with deep expertise in automation, analytics, and governance.
    Abhishek Chandna: Thanks, Subhasis. Great to be here, and I’m really excited to talk about the real side of finance transformation—beyond the buzzwords.
    Subhasis: Let’s start with the biggest challenges you’ve seen in finance teams trying to adopt automation or data-led decision-making.
    Abhishek: I’d say the top three blockers are:
    Change resistance – Teams often build solutions in silos and forget stakeholder alignment.
    Automating broken processes – If the process is flawed, automation just speeds up failure.
    Too many tech choices – People get lost comparing tools. It’s better to start with the outcome, not the tech.
    Subhasis: Couldn’t agree more. The fear of change and confusion around tools often derail good initiatives. What makes an automation project successful in your experience?
    Abhishek: I follow a 5-step approach:
    Identify a real business pain point. Don’t automate for the sake of it.
    Standardize the process. Get alignment and remove inefficiencies.
    Build an MVP and iterate. Use agile methods to refine early.
    Enable adoption with support. Training, playbooks, and office hours help.
    Measure success. Track both time saved and how that time is repurposed.
    Subhasis: That’s a playbook right there. But early in the journey, how can teams tell if they’re on the right track?
    Abhishek: Look for improvements in user experience—even small ones. Also, track qualitative metrics, not just hours saved. Outcome-based thinking goes a long way.
    Subhasis: Let’s talk about data governance. Why is it often overlooked?
    Abhishek: Because it’s like flossing—nobody loves it, but it’s essential. Without it, every dashboard becomes a debate. Good governance builds trust. The keys are:
    Embed governance in tools users already use
    Establish clear ownership
    Change the perception that governance is red tape.
    It’s not about being powerful—it’s about being useful.
    Subhasis: Totally. At FinFloh, we follow that same principle—meeting users where they are. Let’s shift to the bigger picture: how have you seen finance tech evolve?
    Abhishek: We’ve moved from systems of record, to systems of insight, and now toward systems of intelligence. Tools are more real-time, agile, and AI-powered. But the transformation isn’t just tech—it’s people, process, and tools evolving together.
    Subhasis: When should finance teams build vs. buy?
    Abhishek: Always start with: What problem are we solving? Complex tools with no adoption are useless. Simple tools solving real problems succeed. That principle helps you decide whether to build, buy, or optimize.
    Subhasis: And where does AI stand today?
    Abhishek: It’s not just hype—but we’re not quite at “line item in the budget” either. Smart teams are investing in AI readiness:
    Clean, structured data
    Strong governance
    Standardized processes
    That’s the foundation for real AI use cases to thrive.
    Subhasis: Do you use AI tools like ChatGPT?
    Abhishek: Absolutely. I use it to brainstorm logic for Power BI, write process documentation, and accelerate content generation. It’s about using AI as a co-pilot—not a replacement.
    Subhasis: That’s the real spirit of augmentation. Abhishek, thanks for this candid and insightful discussion.
    Abhishek: Thank you, Subhasis! Loved this exchange.
    Subhasis: And to all our listeners, thank you for joining us in today’s conversation. Until next time, keep exploring what’s next in AI and finance.`,

      transcript: `Subhasis Sahoo: Hi everyone, I’m Subhasis Sahoo, Head of Marketing at FinFloh. Welcome to Episode 4 of AI in Finance. In this episode, we explore how finance decision-making is evolving with AI and data at the core. I'm joined by Roshan Shanker, Director of Finance at Microsoft Cloud and AI, with over 20 years of experience across finance strategy, operations, and scaling high-performing teams. Welcome, Roshan!
Roshan Shanker: Thanks, Subhasis. Great to be here—really looking forward to this conversation.
Subhasis: To kick us off, can you take us through your career journey—from where it started to your current role at Microsoft?
Roshan: Sure. I grew up in India, studied at BITS Pilani, and began my career in finance and operations roles. I then pursued an MBA at Darden School of Business during the 2008 financial crisis—an intense learning experience. I interned with Microsoft in 2008 and joined full-time in 2009. Since then, I’ve worked in multiple finance roles within Microsoft across various business units. It's been a dynamic and fulfilling 15 years here.
Subhasis: That’s a remarkable journey. Over those years, how have you seen decision-making evolve in finance?
Roshan: It's evolved significantly. Finance has shifted from being backward-looking—focused on explaining variances and results—to being forward-looking with scenario planning, predictive analytics, and what-if modeling. We’ve moved from acting as scorekeepers to being strategic advisors and collaborators. Today, finance partners with not just other finance teams, but also engineering, HR, and go-to-market functions. Decision-making is now dynamic and agile because business conditions change so fast.
Subhasis: What role has technology played in that shift?
Roshan: A huge one. Earlier, we relied on Excel and static reports. Now we work with real-time dashboards through tools like Power BI, which pulls from centralized, governed sources. That gives everyone—from finance to HR to engineering—a single version of truth. It's improved decision speed, reduced version conflicts, and enhanced security through role-based access.
Subhasis: That idea of one source of truth is crucial. We follow the same philosophy at FinFloh, integrating ERP and CRM systems to reduce data gaps. You also mentioned AI—how are you seeing it being used in finance at Microsoft?
Roshan: There are several promising areas.
Forecasting: Using historical data with ML models to predict outcomes—headcount, revenue, expenses.


Anomaly detection: AI helps spot outliers in expenses, fraud, or GL data—things that would take hours of manual review.


Automation: From reporting to monthly close processes, automation reduces errors and frees up teams for more strategic work.


AI chatbots and natural language queries: Imagine asking Excel, “What was headcount in EMEA in 2020?” and getting a direct answer. That’s where we’re headed.


Subhasis: And where do you see untapped opportunities?
Roshan: The biggest opportunity is context-aware AI—tools that understand intent and suggest improvements. For example, if a formula looks off in Excel, AI could prompt a correction. That’s still aspirational today, but possible in the near future. The key is data quality. Without clean, structured data, AI models won’t work well.
Subhasis: That’s an important point—AI’s effectiveness depends on the foundation. Let’s talk about the future. What do you think the next big challenges are for finance leaders?
Roshan: I’d highlight dynamic workforce planning. In tech especially, aligning resources with product roadmaps is key. You need to forecast not just cost, but talent availability, geo-based hiring, attrition, and ramp-up time. Finance has to partner closely with business leaders to inform those resourcing decisions in real-time.
And then there’s the need to look around corners—proactively spotting risks and advising stakeholders before problems surface. That’s the strategic muscle finance needs to keep building.
Subhasis: Couldn’t agree more. As a parting note, what advice would you give to someone looking to grow from analyst to finance leader?
Roshan: Focus on three things:
Finance Skills & Tools – Get strong on fundamentals and know your systems well.


Business Acumen – Understand the business you support. Finance is the language of business.


Relationships – Build connections across teams. That helps you influence and drive outcomes.


Subhasis: That’s gold. Thanks so much for joining us, Roshan—this was a deeply insightful conversation.
Roshan: Thank you, Subhasis. I really enjoyed it.

      transcript: `Subhasis Sahoo: Hi everyone! I'm your host, Subhasis Sahoo, Head of Marketing at FinFloh. Welcome to the third episode of our podcast series, AI in Finance. In this series, we explore how AI is transforming finance teams and reshaping the Office of the CFO. Whether it’s enhancing accounts receivable, optimizing financial operations, or leveraging AI for better decision-making, we bring in industry leaders to share their insights.
I’m thrilled to have Elaine M. Nowak with us today. Elaine and I worked together at HighRadius a few years ago, and she’s been an incredible mentor to me. I’m truly excited to have this conversation with her today.
Elaine is currently the Senior Director of Product Marketing at Auditoria.AI, bringing over three decades of experience in product innovation, marketing, and management. She’s been at the forefront of AI discussions long before it became the buzzword it is today, and I can’t wait to dive into her insights.
Welcome, Elaine!
Elaine M. Nowak: Thanks, Subhasis! It’s great to be here. I’m looking forward to our discussion.
Subhasis Sahoo: Elaine, you have an impressive background—starting in psychology, moving into product marketing, and now leading AI-powered finance solutions. How did that journey unfold?
Elaine M. Nowak: It’s been quite the journey! I actually started with a psychology degree and even got a master’s in art therapy. That background helped me understand consumer behavior, which turned out to be a huge advantage in marketing. Over time, I transitioned from end-to-end marketing in small firms to more specialized roles at larger companies.
My passion for finance technology really took off when I joined HighRadius, where I worked closely with customers, developed case studies, and drove customer advocacy. Later, I moved into alliance management and product marketing, which led me to my current role at Auditoria.AI.
Subhasis Sahoo: That’s an incredible transition! Let’s dive into finance technology. You’ve seen the landscape evolve over the years. How has finance tech changed from when you started to where we are now?
Elaine M. Nowak: Finance has always been risk-averse—and for good reason! Finance teams work with highly sensitive data, and security has always been a priority. Because of this, the industry lagged behind in AI adoption for a long time.
But that’s changing. We’ve moved from manual data entry and paper-based workflows to automated, AI-driven finance operations. Even now, some companies still use paper invoices and checks, which is surprising! But AI is starting to connect systems, streamline workflows, and drive efficiencies we couldn’t imagine a decade ago.
Subhasis Sahoo: That’s so true! With AI, finance teams no longer have to spend time on repetitive tasks—they can focus on insights and strategic decision-making. In your experience, what are the biggest challenges companies face when adopting AI?
Elaine M. Nowak: There are three key challenges:
1️⃣ Trust & Explainability – Finance leaders need to understand how AI makes decisions before they trust it. Black-box AI doesn’t work in finance—teams need transparency.
2️⃣ Data Quality & Integration – AI is only as good as the data it’s trained on. If finance teams don’t have clean, structured data, AI adoption will be difficult and ineffective.
3️⃣ Change Management – AI adoption isn’t just about technology—it’s about people. If teams aren’t trained properly or resistant to change, AI implementations fail.
Subhasis Sahoo: Great points! AI adoption is as much about culture as it is about technology. Let’s talk about AI’s impact on Invoice-to-Cash and Accounts Receivable. What are some of the biggest AI-driven transformations happening in this space?
Elaine M. Nowak: AI is completely reshaping invoice-to-cash (I2C). Here’s how:
✅ Automated Collections & Follow-Ups – AI can segment customers, prioritize follow-ups, and trigger reminders based on payment behavior.
✅ Dispute Detection & Resolution – AI scans emails, invoices, and contracts to detect potential disputes before they escalate.
✅ Cash Application Automation – AI can match payments to invoices in seconds, reducing manual effort and reconciliation errors.
✅ Predictive Analytics for Credit Decisions – AI analyzes buyer payment behavior and market trends to refine credit scoring.
Finance teams that adopt AI in AR are seeing faster collections, fewer disputes, and improved cash flow visibility.
Subhasis Sahoo: Exactly! AI isn’t just automating finance—it’s making it smarter. But some finance leaders worry that AI will replace jobs. What’s your take on that?
Elaine M. Nowak: AI won’t replace jobs—it will redefine them. AI is here to handle the repetitive, time-consuming tasks, so finance professionals can focus on strategic decision-making. The future isn’t about AI replacing humans—it’s about AI-augmented finance teams.
Subhasis Sahoo: That’s a powerful perspective! Before we wrap up, let’s look ahead. What do you think the next decade of AI in finance will look like?
Elaine M. Nowak: Over the next 10 years, we’ll see:
🚀 Agentic AI – AI will proactively identify risks, automate workflows, and make real-time recommendations.
🚀 Finance as a Strategic Function – The CFO’s role will expand beyond financial reporting to business strategy and risk management.
🚀 Seamless AI Integrations – AI will connect ERP, billing, and CRM systems, eliminating data silos.
We’re heading toward fully autonomous finance operations, where AI isn’t just assisting—it’s driving decision-making in real time.
Subhasis Sahoo: That’s an exciting future! Elaine, this has been an amazing conversation. Thank you for sharing your insights!
Elaine M. Nowak: Thanks, Subhasis! It’s been great chatting with you.
Subhasis Sahoo: And to all our listeners, thanks for tuning in! Stay connected for more deep dives into AI and the Office of the CFO. Until next time, keep exploring What’s AI in Finance?

      transcript: `Subhasis Sahoo: Hi everyone! I'm your host, Subhasis Sahoo, Head of Marketing at FinFloh. Welcome to the second episode of our podcast series, AI in Finance. In this series, we dive deep into the world of AI and its transformative impact on finance teams—whether it’s optimizing accounts receivable, making smarter credit decisions, or streamlining cash flow processes. Our goal is to break down how AI empowers finance teams and reshapes the Office of the CFO.

For today’s episode, we have Mohit Sharma, a senior leader in Global Strategy and Consulting at Accenture, specializing in CFO and enterprise value. Together, we’ll explore how AI is reshaping the invoice-to-cash process and what it means for finance professionals.

Welcome to the podcast, Mohit! How have you been?

Mohit Sharma: Thanks, Subhasis! I’m doing great. Excited to be here and discuss AI’s role in finance.

Subhasis Sahoo: Fantastic! Before we dive into today’s topic, I’d love for our audience to get to know you better. You started as a Process Developer at Convergys and went on to hold leadership roles at Accenture, IBM, Capgemini, HighRadius, and many more. That’s 22 years of experience in finance transformation! What key moments have defined your career so far?

Mohit Sharma: That question takes me down memory lane! When I started, the outsourcing industry was in its early days. I worked with legacy systems, green-screen monitors, and land cable networks—things that feel ancient now. I moved from CRM to finance early on and then shifted into finance transformation consulting.

One of the biggest turning points was joining Genpact (then GE Capital International Services) in 2002. That was when I truly understood reengineering finance operations. By 2008-09, cloud computing and analytics were emerging, and I shifted into technology-driven finance transformation.

At IBM, I led the development of AP workflow automation products, which we deployed to over 80 global customers in just two years. That period was a golden phase—because automation was just taking off, and even basic AI, like OCR for invoice processing, was seen as a breakthrough.

Later, at Accenture, I focused on order-to-cash, procure-to-pay, and record-to-report transformations. I even worked on AI-powered fraud prevention tools, one of which was patented. Today, I write a newsletter called Beyond Human, covering AI’s evolution in finance.

Subhasis Sahoo: That’s an incredible journey! Given your experience, what would you say have been the biggest challenges in driving finance transformation?

Mohit Sharma: I’d highlight three major challenges:

1️⃣ Convincing businesses to invest in technology. AI isn’t just about automation—it’s about delivering value. But articulating that value in a compelling way is tough. Many finance leaders still struggle to see AI’s full potential beyond cost savings.

2️⃣ Governance & business model alignment. Companies buy top-tier finance tools without a proper governance structure, leading to underutilization. Without clear ownership and accountability, even the best AI systems won’t deliver results.

3️⃣ Lack of continuous learning. Finance professionals must invest time in understanding both AI and business strategy. Many don’t allocate even a few hours a week to upskilling, which slows AI adoption and limits innovation.

Subhasis Sahoo: That’s a great breakdown! AI adoption is accelerating, but many still struggle with where and how to apply it. From your perspective, how is AI truly transforming finance operations?

Mohit Sharma: AI is revolutionizing finance in four key areas:

Predictive analytics: AI enables finance teams to forecast cash flow trends and make data-driven decisions in real time.

AI-powered collections & dispute resolution: AI can predict late payments and automate dispute detection, saving weeks of manual effort.

Credit decisioning: AI can analyze both internal AR data and external market intelligence to assess customer risk dynamically.

Agentic AI for finance automation: AI bots can autonomously handle reconciliations, anomaly detection, and AR management, reducing human intervention.

Finance teams that embrace AI are seeing improvements in DSO reduction, dispute resolution efficiency, and working capital optimization.

Subhasis Sahoo: That’s exciting! AI-driven finance isn’t just about automation—it’s about proactive decision-making. Let’s get specific—how do you see AI impacting the invoice-to-cash process?

Mohit Sharma: Invoice-to-cash (I2C) is one of the most fragmented processes in finance. AI is solving key pain points like:

✅ AI-driven collections – Predictive analytics can prioritize collections based on customer behavior and payment patterns, reducing overdue invoices.
✅ Dispute detection & resolution – AI can identify disputes before they escalate, analyzing patterns across customer deductions.
✅ Credit risk management – AI models, like what FinFloh is doing, can combine receivables data with third-party insights to refine credit scoring and predict defaults.
✅ Cash application automation – AI can match payments to invoices even when remittance details are missing, reducing manual reconciliation efforts.

These AI applications are making finance teams more strategic and less reactive.

Subhasis Sahoo: Exactly! AI is unlocking insights that were impossible to surface manually. But many finance leaders worry that AI will replace jobs. What’s your take on this?

Mohit Sharma: AI won’t replace jobs—it will redefine them. It’s not about AI vs. humans; it’s about humans with AI vs. humans without AI.

Finance professionals need to adapt, not resist. AI will eliminate repetitive tasks, allowing teams to focus on strategy, decision-making, and customer relationships. Companies that don’t leverage AI will fall behind—not because of AI itself, but because their competitors will be faster and more efficient.

Subhasis Sahoo: That’s a great perspective! Before we wrap up, let’s look ahead. What AI advancements do you see shaping finance in the next 10 years?

Mohit Sharma: In the next decade, we’ll see:

🚀 End-to-end AI-powered finance platforms – Collections, disputes, and credit decisions will be fully automated, reducing reliance on separate tools.
🚀 Predictive finance intelligence – AI will enable CFOs to anticipate financial risks and optimize cash flow in real time.
🚀 Quantum AI & finance automation – AI and quantum computing will revolutionize complex financial modeling, enabling CFOs to simulate economic scenarios instantly.

Collections and disputes as standalone processes might disappear—AI will handle them proactively, before issues even arise.

Subhasis Sahoo: That’s an exciting future! AI is redefining finance, and businesses that embrace it early will gain a competitive edge. Mohit, this has been an incredibly insightful conversation—thank you for sharing your expertise!

Mohit Sharma: Thanks, Subhasis! It’s been great discussing AI’s impact on finance. Looking forward to seeing how AI continues to evolve.

Subhasis Sahoo: And to all our listeners, thank you for tuning in! Stay connected for more deep dives into AI and the Office of the CFO. Until next time, keep exploring What’s AI in Finance?`,

Before FinFloh, he co-founded Ubic Technologies, which was acquired by a listed payments entity, InfiBeam Avenues, in 2022. He has also held leadership roles at Cashfree Payments, Digio, Timo, and KPMG.
Welcome to the podcast, Amartya! How’s your day been so far?
Amartya Singh: Thanks, Subhasis! Really excited to be a part of this podcast. Looking forward to discussing some of the most exciting advancements in AI and finance.
Subhasis Sahoo: That’s great to hear! Let’s dive right in. We’ve worked together for over a year now, and I know you’ve been a strong advocate of AI since your college days. What sparked your fascination with AI?
Amartya Singh: My love for AI goes way back. A fun personal trivia—my final-year engineering project was focused on AI applications in healthcare. We worked on decision trees for disease prediction based on symptoms and clustering algorithms to map disease patterns across regions. We even won multiple awards and had strong backing from industry experts and government bodies.
That early experience convinced me of AI’s immense potential to transform industries. Today, at FinFloh, we are applying AI to finance teams, optimizing accounts receivable, and driving smarter credit decisions—and the journey is only getting more exciting!
Subhasis Sahoo: That’s a fascinating journey! AI has rapidly evolved and is now a game-changer for businesses. Finance teams, in particular, are increasingly leveraging AI to streamline operations and improve efficiency. From your perspective, how is AI truly transforming the Office of the CFO?
Amartya Singh: AI’s evolution has been incredible. We’ve moved from machine learning and deep neural networks to today’s generative AI revolution. AI is no longer just for businesses—it’s now embedded into everyday tasks, from writing emails to creating content, coding, designing, and even architecture.
For CFOs, AI is revolutionizing financial operations in ways we’ve never seen before:
Accounts receivable automation: AI-powered workflows optimize collection strategies and reduce late payments.
Predictive analytics: AI forecasts cash flow trends, helping finance teams make data-driven decisions in real time.
Generative AI assistants: Virtual finance assistants provide instant insights—whether for board meetings, financial reviews, or day-to-day analysis—without needing manual report extractions.
AI-driven credit decisions: AI helps assess customer credit risk at the onboarding stage directly within Salesforce, allowing for smarter, faster decision-making.
These innovations allow finance teams to reduce manual effort, enhance accuracy, and focus on strategic growth rather than routine tasks.
Subhasis Sahoo: That’s a great breakdown! AI is truly streamlining finance functions and empowering teams to make faster, more informed decisions. Given the breadth of AI’s applications, how are finance leaders responding to these advancements?
Amartya Singh: The response from finance leaders has been overwhelmingly positive. AI is no longer just a futuristic concept—it’s a top priority for CFOs today. I recently spoke with the CFO of a major SaaS company, and when I asked about their top three focus areas, the answer was simple: AI, AI, and AI.
Finance leaders are actively looking for automation solutions to improve productivity, enhance decision-making, and drive cost efficiency. The impact has been clear across areas like:
Increased cash flow predictability
Faster credit approvals & risk assessment
Higher efficiency in collections & dispute resolution
At FinFloh, we’re even developing an AI investment calculator to quantify the ROI of AI-driven finance solutions, helping CFOs make informed adoption decisions.
Subhasis Sahoo: That’s fantastic! With AI becoming a core pillar of modern finance, many companies are eager to implement it but aren’t sure where to start. What advice would you give to businesses looking to build an AI-driven finance strategy?
Amartya Singh: Great question! The biggest pitfall I see is companies adopting AI just for the sake of AI. Instead, the right approach is:
1️⃣ Identify the problem first – Start with a well-defined business problem and determine if AI is the right solution.
2️⃣ Ensure high-quality data – AI is only as good as the data it’s trained on. Clean, structured data is key to building effective AI models.
3️⃣ Validate and scale – Test AI in small, high-impact areas before scaling adoption across finance functions.
If applied thoughtfully, AI can increase productivity, enhance efficiency, reduce errors, and drive better decision-making.
Subhasis Sahoo: That’s solid advice! AI should always be a means to solve real business challenges, not just a buzzword. This was an insightful discussion, Amartya. AI is clearly transforming finance, making processes smarter, faster, and more efficient.
To all our listeners—thank you for tuning in! Stay connected for more deep dives into AI and the Office of the CFO. Until next time, keep exploring What’s AI in Finance?

Amartya (Intro): Brandon brings over a decade of hands-on Order-to-Cash experience across high-growth and complex billing environments—it’s great to have him on our very first episode.

Brandon: I started my O2C journey over ten years ago, and scaling through growth and acquisitions really changes how billing and orders behave.

Amartya: Your journey shows what happens when O2C scales fast—systems, processes, and teams are constantly tested.

📄 Orders, Invoices & Revenue Leakage
Brandon: Orders are the foundation of invoices—without solid orders, your invoicing leaks revenue.

Amartya: That gap between sales, finance, and billing is where most mismatches quietly begin.

Brandon: We had no way to connect sales orders to invoices without reviewing each one manually—and that led to revenue leakage.

Amartya: This is where CRM structure really matters, not just billing systems.

Brandon: When your CRM is weak, you lose visibility—and that directly impacts revenue and customer experience.

🔧 Transformation & Process Fixes
Amartya: You also highlighted that technology alone doesn’t solve problems—how it’s set up does.

Brandon: Sometimes you already have the right tools—they’re just not configured correctly.

Amartya: Your transformation story around mass actions really stood out.

Brandon: We rebuilt six failing mass actions into three with audit trails—and saved multiple team seats as a result.

Amartya: That’s a powerful example of simplification driving scale.

🤖 AI, Automation & Efficiency
Brandon: AI wasn’t the answer for invoice validation—automation using existing systems worked better.

Amartya: And that shift freed teams to focus on higher-value work instead of constant rechecks.

Brandon: We’ve already saved 30–40% of invoicing time, and we’re aiming for 70% plus in the next phases.

Amartya: Your phased view of AI—from revenue leakage to analytics, automation, and security—really brings clarity.

Brandon: AI will help find problems faster, but humans still matter—especially for complex and high-value orders.

🎯 Closing
Amartya: That balance between automation and human judgment is what modern O2C teams need.

Amartya (Closing): This mindset—strong order foundations, thoughtful automation, and people-first leadership—is exactly what Credit to Cash Leaders is about.
